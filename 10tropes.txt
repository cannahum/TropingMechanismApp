- TV Tropes", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, they make you completely forget about those giant hawk wings, don't they?\n\nShe's a revolution, she's a peace accord She's a grain of sand, she's the Cliffs of Moher She's Friday night, she's Sunday Morning She's a fair wind, she's a sailor\u0092s warning\n Green eyes, red hair, long legs She's got the Devil inside her\n\u2014 Gaelic Storm, \"Green Eyes, Red Hair\"\nGreen-eyed redheads are among the rarest color combinations found in humanity (with the exception of some abnormalities), and thus is used to distinguish an important, notable character visually. It's more often found with women than with men, and is almost always either found as a trait of The Hero (see Red-Headed Hero) or The Hero's Love Interest (because Heroes Want Redheads). To qualify for this trope, it's important that:\n The character is a major character.\n The character is not in a work where You Gotta Have Blue Hair.\n The character isn't from a live-action work, unless they were artificially given these colors for the purpose of the work, or were chosen directly for it.\n The character has red hair and green eyes, and not pink/magenta hair or hazel/blue-green eyes, or even green hair and red eyes.\nLikely to be a Fiery Redhead, as Green Eyes often connote a similar kind of personality.\nThis image might have been influenced a lot by Maureen O'Hara and her various roles, which also influenced this to be the Phenotype Stereotype for an Irish person. It may also have something to do with the fact that red and green are complementary colours - which also may help to explain why so many red-headed characters are depicted wearing green, even if they aren't Irish.\n\nExamples\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0open/close all folders\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anime & Manga\u00a0\n\n Youko Nakajima from The Twelve Kingdoms is a prime example. She's the main character, and her red hair\u0086\u00a0 (which gets redder when she goes to the titular Kingdoms, along with her eyes turning green) marks her as different, so she is often harassed for it. It also marks her as a taika, someone who was meant to be in that world but was born on Earth by accident.\n Shirayuki from Snow White with the Red Hair is another prime example.\n Kurama of YuYu Hakusho, at least in his human form, but only in the anime. The crimson hair/leaf-green eyes combination in this case is a warning not to underestimate him, because, like his roses, he has thorns. It's also a hint at his nature as a Kitsune and a youkai, as there are folk stories of red-headed green-eyed people actually being foxes and in disguise and the shade of red being decidedly unnatural for a human.\n Hellsing's Pip Bernadotte, Love Interest of Seras Victoria. While he's a mercenary and an Anti-Hero to be traditionally sweet, he is the nicest of the guys in these series along with Sir Shelby Penwood. With the other men being Dracula, a deadly butler, Nazis, and Fanatic Vatican Crusaders, Pip looks like a saint.\n\n Brief in Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, whose red hair emphasizes his geeky qualities, and then, with the reveal of his eyes emphasizes he is attractive.\n Kino Makoto/Sailor Jupiter from Sailor Moon is one of the main characters and in the manga, and her hair red in color pictures, (brown in the anime). Word of God says that her eyes turn green after transforming into Jupiter, and they look more hazel/brown in her untransformed state in some artwork.\n Lydia from Earl and Fairy has this as a sign of her affinity with The Fair Folk. It's a source of great trouble for her due to the cultural discrimination people with red hair suffered in Victorian England, on top of the implications she might be a changeling.\n Nakaba from Reimei No Arcana is the protagonist. Her bright red hair causes her to be discriminated against, and her green eyes turn red when she uses her powers. She's also in the middle of a love triangle between the romantic lead, and her Childhood Friend.\n Lancerow Durell of After War Gundam X isn't The Hero or a Love Interest, but he was Jamil Neate's Rival during the last war, an ex-Newtype, and an Anti-Villain in the Space Revolutionary Army. He plays a very important part of the final arc and ultimately switches to the heroes' side.\n The final major cyborg introduced in Gunslinger Girl, Petra, is one of these. Prior to being made a cyborg she looked very different though, far shorter and being a blue eyed blonde.\n Misty from Pok\u00e9mon was the leading female for the Kanto and Johto arcs. She was often portrayed with Blue Eyes but since the leap to digital has been almost always consistently depicted as having green eyes. In the manga adaptation The Electric Tale of Pikachu she was originally a brunette but was later redesigned more similarly to her anime design.\n Misty in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures is much less prominent but still counts. She is one of the major Kanto gym leaders and has unrequited feelings for Red.\n The protagonist of Venus Versus Virus, Sumire, has dark red hair and green eyes. Her eyes turn red when she goes into Berserk mode.\n In Panzer World Galient, Hilmuka has this combination of colour of hair and eyes. She's one of the main characters and an important ally of Jordy, teaching him to handle Galient and sharing intelligence about the enemy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comic Books\u00a0\n DC comics' Wally West, the third Flash\n X-Men:\n Jean Grey is the one of the original members of the team, the love interest of Cyclops, and took center stage in what is arguably the franchise's best known story.\n Also Jean's daughter from an alternate future, Rachel, and her clone, Madelyne Pryor.\n Also Hope Summers, a very important player in the X-Men franchise and obviously takes after Jean.\n Fongji Wu, a mixed-race Tibetan girl and the previous bearer of both the Phoenix Force and the Iron Fist mantle.\n Rogue was occasionally colored with just straight-up red hair with green eyes, especially during her most popular years in the '90s, but did eventually move to brown.\n Mary Jane Watson from Spider-Man is the love interest of Peter Parker, has been a supermodel, and is known for striking good looks, as opposed to Gwen Stacy's more traditional Girl Next Door appearance (despite MJ being the literal girl next door).\n\n Batwoman / Kate Kane, the main character of her own series, whose coloration, especially her red hair, is starkly emphasized against dark and bleak Gotham.\n Lyra, daughter of Thundra and The Hulk, combines this with green skin.\n Lena Luthor, at least in Supergirl: Cosmic Adventurs in the 8th Grade. Also the \"Lex's daughter\" incarnation in The DCU ... although in this case her green eyes may have indicated that she was still connected to Brainiac.\n Superman has two major characters who meet this description. One is Lana Lang, his childhood best friend, confidante, and first love (and who briefly acted as a surrogate mother to his cousin, Supergirl). The other is archenemy Lex Luthor, who has envious green eyes and flaming red eyebrows as an adult, and possessed a full head of red hair as a teenager.\n Caitlin Fairchild from Gen\u00b9\u00b3 is this physically as well as usually personality wise (though she can be a Fiery Redhead when it comes to protecting the others).\n Poison Ivy, whose coloration not only emphasizes her seductive qualities, but also seems more dangerous and earthy.\n Rogue's hair is usually referred to as \"auburn\", but was colored more red in earlier comics. And her eyes are green.\n Starfire, with golden skin. Note that while it's true that Starfire has green eyes, that doesn't mean she has normal eyes with green irises... it means her eyes are solid green.\n Leetah and her daughter Ember, as well as Redlance and his daughter Tyleet in ElfQuest. Notable because Leetah and Ember are both dark-skinned. Averted with Kaslen in Hidden Years, as she turned out to have no special significance to the plot.\n The Incredibles: Mezmerella.\n Archie Comics:\n Third-Option Love Interest Cheryl Blossom is one of the few characters that consistently has colored eyes. Most characters have Black Bead Eyes.\n Archie himself has green eyes in Archie Comics (2015). In the classic continuity he usually had blue eyes.\n\n Delirium from The Sandman is this on occasion. She can change her hair color/length at will (but mostly it happens by accident), though it usually has some red in it and is fully red at least once. Usually has one green and one blue eye, though when she composes herself and behaves seriously they are the same color.\n Aphrodite in the \"Adventures in Olympus\" arc of Flare, notable in that the most beautiful person to exist has this combination of color, and is in fact often portrayed as a redhead in art, especially Pre-Raphaelite and Neoclassicism.\n Rose in the Wolverine miniseries Origin, who is intended as a \"proto-Jean Grey\" in Wolverine's story, just as Dog is a \"proto-Sabretooth\".\n Angel Love, the main character of the eponymous comic book series.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fan Works\u00a0\n\n Assassin, adventuress and safari-savvy Johanna Smith-Rhodes, from the Discworld continuum fanfic Nature Studies. She started life as a rather attitudinal \"Sed-Efrrrrikan\" with all the knobs turned up to eleven.\n Julia Carlyle, from the Daria/Legion of Super-Heroes crossover Legion of Lawndale Heroes, has dark red hair and green eyes.\n The (in)famous Axis Powers Hetalia OC, Pixiv!Scotland. Also some renditions of Ireland, following the aformentioned Phenotype Stereotype. Others make him/her a Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette instead, specifically to go against it.\n\n Mary Jane Watson, the protagonist of Ultimate Spider-Woman: Change With The Light, has long, fire-red hair and bright green eyes.\n Captain Kanril Eleya, the protagonist of Bait and Switch (STO), is has red hair and dark green eyes.\n Judicial-Cadet Jacqueline Quartermain from this series of Dredd fanfics is a gorgeous teenager with hair like \"new copper wiring\" and brilliant green eyes. She's from Boston and word of God is that she is ethnically Irish, perhaps justifying the choice.\n In The Ultimate Evil, we're introduced Nataline Homato, a demon hunter who's described for a reason as Buffy The Vampire Slayer's long lost cousin.\n In most Death Note fanworks where Matt is featured, he will have red hair and green eyes (and, of course, a much larger role than he ever had in either the anime or the manga.) This is because his hair color was undefined in the manga (until the 10th anniversary colorized publication, where he had the brown hair and blue eyes he was given in the anime). Fanon decided that his hair color was red, and his eyes were green.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Film \u2014 Animated\u00a0\n Danny from Cats Don't Dance, the lead, is also an example of an orange-furred cat with green eyes.\n Hans in Frozen, a very handsome prince who is an immediate source of attraction to main character Anna, herself an example (though her eye color is closer to teal).\n Thomas O'Malley and Toulouse (one of Duchess' kittens) from The Aristocats, both ginger cats with cat-green eyes, in contrast with Duchess and Marie's white fur (see: blonde) and blue eyes.\n Taran from The Black Cauldron, the hero of the story.\n Quasimodo, the protagonist from The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n Queen Athena from The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, whose red hair is very relevant to her physical resemblance to Ariel.\n Jessie as the Affirmative Action Girl lead in Toy Story 2, as well as being Buzz's Love Interest in Toy Story 3.\n Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the wife of the titular character. It's easy to miss, as few people are looking at her eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Film \u2014 Live-Action\u00a0\n As played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Daphne Blake in the live-action Scooby-Doo movies, whose hair is dyed to give her this look.\n Layla from Sky High is worth mentioning due her being an Expy (at least in powers; her personality is quite different) of Poison Ivy, another character with notable Red hair and green eyes that has power over plants.\n Though in the \"Harry Potter\" books, Harry has green eyes and Ron blue, this is inverted in the film versions with Harry being played by Daniel Radcliffe (blue eyes) and Ron by Rupert Grint (red hair/green eyes).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Literature\u00a0\n In Dragon Blood, the magician \"Jade Eyes\", named for those green eyes, has red hair. It is mentioned that his beauty is not the reason why he's the highest mage in rank at the king's court\u2014he's also a powerful mage who makes life difficult for the heroes.  Actually, in terms of power, he's the main villain.\n All of the Pennykettles from The Last Dragon Chronicles are this.\n Star Wars Legends:\n Mara Jade may be the ultimate example: a Badass and former Evil Redhead who was so enormously popular, she joined the good guys, became The Hero Luke's long-time partner, and was eventually happily married to him. Until Legacy of the Force, but no one likes what happened there.\n Scout, the Jedi Padawan equivalent of Batman in Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, has these.\n Jedi Apprentice's Clat'Ha is only in a few of the books, but she's significant in them.\n Anne Shirley of Anne of Green Gables, where her hair and eye color is significant in that she personally dislikes the combination.\n Lily Evans Potter from Harry Potter series is a Posthumous Character example: a formidable witch of her own, she was the love interest to James, The Hero of the previous generation, and friends with Severus Snape, until they had a falling out, but whose death became Snape's primary motivation.\n Gemma Doyle, the protagonist from the A Great and Terrible Beauty trilogy. Her mother too.\n Maharet and Mekare from The Vampire Chronicles, as well as Jesse.\n Partly justified with Jesse, as she is Maharet's distant descendant. All three women are capable of communicating with spirits.\n Ellysetta Baristani, the main character of Tairen Soul.\n\n Beatrice Bailey, the protagonist of The Witches of Bailiwick. Her specialty is controlling the weather, which goes with the nature aspect of this trope.\n Christopher Hitchens mentioned this trope while criticizing a stereotypically Irish-American character in John Updike's last novel.\n The title character of Fire is red-headed and green-eyed and beautiful beyond the lot of ordinary people; her hair and eye color both coming from her mother.\n Felicity Merriman, a main character from the American Girls Collection, one of the few redheads who, by the nature of this trope, of course is paired with green eyes.\n Vesper Holly, Mary Sue protagonist of a Narm Charm-tastic children's adventure series by Lloyd Alexander. Just look at that name!\n Sennar, one of the main characters of the Chronicles of the Emerged World.\n\n Cherry Valance from The Outsiders is the redhead with green eyes that starts all the trouble in the book, while allowing Ponyboy, the protagonist, to change his view on Socs.\n Kvothe in The Kingkiller Chronicle, who has \"true red\" hair. His eyes even have the bonus of changing to different shades of green according to his mood.\n April, one of the main characters from Everworld is mentioned a few times to be this.\n Rachel Morgan and her mother in The Hollows.\n Sioned, one of the main characters from Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince stories.\n\n Finnick Odair of The Hunger Games, who is not only described as very attractive, but the only major redhead of the series, and one of the most important secondary characters.\n\n The Girl from The Club Dumas; her very light green eyes are mentioned many times as being captivating, likely because she is in fact a fallen angel. In the film adaptation, The Ninth Gate, however, she has different coloring.\n Mildmay, one of the viewpoint characters of Doctrine of Labyrinths. For most of the story, he's one of only two-redhaired people, the other being his brother, and the only redhead with green eyes. Felix often describes them as being like jade.\n\n A Brother's Price makes a point of noting that all of the princesses fit this trope, to the point where their hair is called \"the royal red\". Cira/Halley actually dyed her hair black to throw off suspicion.\n Ce'Nedra from David Eddings' The Belgariad and The Mallorean, who is the beautiful, Fiery Redhead love interest of The Hero, and is part-dryad, so comes with a nature emphasis too.\n Brian O'Neill as well as his children Molly and Michael, in Claire Madras's Ireland-set Historical Fiction novel Sissi in Ireland.\n\n The heroine of The Mortal Instruments, Clary Fray has green eyes and red hair. She got them from her mother Jocelyn.\n Pippi Longstocking.\n Sister Fidelma from the books by Peter Tremayne.\n\n Elsabeth Soesten, the main protagonist of the fantasy novella No Good Deed..., has copper hair and green eyes as prominent character traits.\n\n\n\n Ruby-haired, emerald-eyed Aristomache of The First Dwarf King is one of the most notable characters in the book who isn't Jani.\n Iris would also count, save for the fact that she has blue eyes instead of green.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Live Action Television\u00a0\n Merlin in the 1998 miniseries, where it appears that both young and old Merlins's eyes were digitally enhanced to be green beyond reality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Music\u00a0\n In Dolly Parton's song \"Jolene\", the titular character (and the narrator's romantic rival) has \"flaming locks of auburn hair\" and \"eyes of emerald green\".\n William Sheller's song \"Les miroirs dans la boue\" (The Mirrors in the Mud) is all about a young girl with \"green eyes bathed in red hair\" (\"les yeux verts noy\u00e9s de cheveux roux\").\n Gaelic Storm's Green Eyes, Red Hair is all about this. The woman in question overlaps with Fiery Redhead too.\n The title character of Erutan's \"The Willow Maid\", who is described as having \"hair like fire, her eyes an emerald sheen\", a tree fairy that a young man becomes infatuated with and tries repeatedly to get her to go with him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mythology\u00a0\n Thor in Norse Mythology is a rough tough badass god, who happens to be redheaded and green-eyed. Yet when he had to cross-dress as a woman in Thrymskvida, all the giants were so smitten by \"her\" dazzling looks that they failed to notice many, many less-than-subtle hints of a trap...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tabletop Games\u00a0\n Of the pantheon worshiped by humans in the Forgotten Realms, the green-eyed redhead, Sune, is the Love Goddess.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Video Games\u00a0\n Mass Effect 2:\n The Bridge Bunny Kelly Chambers is probably the most trouble-free and relaxing romantic interest (for both genders), and the only redhead.\n Default female Commander Shepard is another example, whose first face model was given this coloration. Emphasizing the pervasiveness of this trope is that when a fan poll was created to choose the new look of Commander Shepard for Mass Effect 3, so many people indicated that their vote depended a lot on getting a redheaded, green-eyed Shepard with their favorite face model that the developers posted a second poll allowing people to pick the coloration, and the green-eyed redhead won by a large margin.\n Aveline Vallen in Dragon Age II, is the first companion you pick up and is a green-eyed redhead. Unusually she's also one of the two companions who cannot be Hawke's Love Interest. Much of her character plot in the game focuses on her surprising subversion of gender roles, so it's possible this coloration was picked for that reason.\n If you squint hard enough, you'll notice that pre-zergification Sarah Kerrigan from Starcraft series had grayish-green eyes (especially on that photo Raynor has of her in SC2), and she was a redhead.\n Luke Fon Fabre from Tales of the Abyss. This is actually a plot point, as a noble with red hair and green eyes has a great role in a prophesy that will lead to world prosperity. Asch the Bloody is also a green-eyed red head, which is significant because  in truth, he's the redhead from the prophesy, and Luke is only his clone.\n It later becomes a plot point that Natalia is not one of these, as every blood member of the Kimlascan royal family is a green-eyed redhead.\n Princess Carranya in part II of Love And War, who is the heroine and only playable female character in the episode. Whether she ends up as Ryan's love interest is strongly hinted at, but not confirmed.\n In the remake of The Secret of Monkey Island, Elaine Marley, love interest of the hero, is given red hair and green eyes.\n Saya Kho in the X-Universe series. Red hair, green eyes, spectacular body, and she started a war that eventually resulted in the entire jumpgate network shutting down.\n Crash Bandicoot:\n The titular characters has green eyes and red fur. His hair was red until Crash Twinsanity made it brown.\n His little sister Coco usually has the same fur and eye colors but is downplayed by her blonde hair.\n Triss Merigold, the main love interest in The Witcher and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. Interestingly, in Sapkowski's novels (on which the games are based) she has blue eyes.\n Misty from Pok\u00e9mon is one of these. She's one of the most iconic gym leaders, partially because she's the second in the series but mostly because of the anime.\n Elora from Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! is a faun with red hair and green eyes. She's the main female character but disappears aside from a cameo at the end of the third game.\n Gaige is your mad scientist cyborg teen Pre-order/DLC from Borderlands 2, surprisingly capable in taking out just as many bandits as a seasoned veteran who recently got kicked out of the military. Oh, and she sawed her own arm off out of doing a science fair project.\n The main character of Star Fox is a green-eyed red fox named Fox McCloud.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Webcomics\u00a0\n\n Mistress Sixx from Collar 6 is another lesbian love interest to the protagonist.\n The Title Character of Cucumber Quest, destined to save the world and thus rather significant for its continuous survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lucy Thompson, Superhero School secretary and best-friend to the lead in Pulse.\n Keychain of Creation's Marena, Lancer heroine protagonist and sort-of love interest to Misho combines this with Dark-Skinned Redhead.\n Adele of Agents of the Realm is a dyed redhead, but she's the first friend Norah makes on the campus and one of the Agents.\n\n Penny, The Hero from Penny Blackfeather, as revealed when the comic turns full color.\n Proxy, Tripp's bodyguard from the future.\n Wren from Radio Silence.\n Tegan from Plume, a green-eyed, red-haired Hooker with a Heart of Gold who gives Corrick and Vesper clues where to find Dom and later joins the main ensemble.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Web Original\u00a0\n Cassidy Cain, the titular protagonist of Grandmaster of Theft. She's passionate and sensible as through being a Spirited Young Lady crossed with Classy Cat-Burglar Guile Heroine.\n\n\n The Porcelain Doctor from Dead West. His eyes are technically grey, but since he usually wears green, and keeps on glasses, Gervas mostly desribe his eyes \"green and calming as the sea\".\n We're Alive has Samantha, Datu's love interest who, unfortunately, ended up on the floor of the Arena\n Red vs. Blue has Agent Carolina, the main character of the flashback parts of the Project Freelancer arc.\n Penny in RWBY. Not a Fiery Redhead, though.\n Pyrrha Nikos has very long, very red hair and some of the greenest eyes of any character. She is one of Beacon's star pupils, being Mistral's four-times champion, and has a reputation for being untouchable, partly due to her extremely powerful Semblance which controls magnetism.  She's also Too Cool to Live and Too Good for This Sinful Earth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Western Animation\u00a0\n Kim Possible, the main character, is both an Action Girl and Action Girlfriend example.\n Examples from the DCAU:\n Hawkgirl/Shayera, in Justice League Unlimited, as shown in the trope image, notable in that she was traditionally portrayed with blue eyes in the comics.\n Lana Lang, in Superman: The Animated Series, who, similar to Hawkgirl above, often didn't have green eyes.\n Pamela Isley, a.k.a. Poison Ivy, in the Batman episode \"Pretty Poison\", when she uses her stunning looks to get close to the men who wronged her (one of them even proposes to her) and attempts to assassinate them.\n Gotham City socialite Veronica Vreeland, one of Batman's love interests (and the only redhead amongst them).\n Gargoyles has multiple examples.\n Demona, one of the main antagonists, though ordinarily black-eyed like most gargoyles, qualifies  when in human form.\n Fox, recurring villain employee of and married to the other main antagonist David Xanatos.\n Starfire from Teen Titans. When she's actively using her powers, she has solid green eyes like her comic book counterpart. When she's not, her eyes have are more like normal human \"green eyes\", but the sclera (the \"white\" of the eye) is also green (a paler shade than the iris).\n Kiva from Megas XLR, the only major female character, the only redhead, one of the best looking characters from the show, and eventual love interest of one of the other characters.\n Sam from Totally Spies!, the only redhead of the group (and the rest of the group follows typical cartoon colorations with black hair and brown eyes and blonde hair and blue eyes). She even wears green as her color!\n Gwen Tennyson from Ben 10. The main female character, cousin to the main character, and a part of the most prominent love story in the series with eventual group member Kevin.\n The title character in Atomic Betty.\n Pickles the drummer in Metalocalypse has this sort of coloring, and in his case it's probably due to being \"very Irish-American.\"\n\n Young Justice:\n Kid Flash/Wally West, in accordance to his comic book counterpart.\n Garfield Logan\u2014temporarily. His eyes start out blue, then turn green later. The rest of him followed suit.\u25ca\n Gosalyn Mallard from Darkwing Duck, although the fiery still comes through loud and clear.\n Jessie Bannon from Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures (except when the colourists goof and make them blue).\n Niko in Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers (Depending on the Artist) has bluish-green eyes.\n Lua, the beautiful barefoot Jungle Princess Shaman from Kong: The Animated Series.\n In the Family Guy episode \"Road to the Multiverse\", redhead Lois, whose eye color isn't usually depicted, had green eyes in the Disney 'verse (where she is meant to be portrayed in the classically beautiful way a Disney princess usually is).\n Precious from Pinky and the Brain has green eyes and red fur.\n\n Prototypical TJ from Recess was this. In the final product he's a brunette and has typical, cartoony black eyes.\n Valerie Frizzle from Magic School Bus. Though in the cartoon and book series she, like the kids, usually has typical cartoon eyes, we do get to see her eye color in one book: Explores the Senses.\n A male example, Dr. Krieger from Archer is red-headed, as well as one of the only two green-eyed main characters (along with Lana Kane).\n In Total Drama, Izzy's red hair is more toward the orange end of the spectrum\u2014the color of fire\u2014to emphasize her pyromaniac tendencies. Not only are her eyes green, she also typically wears green.\n Word of God is Wendy from Gravity Falls is this however the art style doesn't show her eye color. She's one of the Pines twins best friends and works at the Mystery Shack.\n Frankie, like everyone in Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, has Black Bead Eyes however her drivers license states she has green eyes. Frankie works at Foster's and is one of Mac's best friends, and the object of his affections.\n The titular protagonist of Strawberry Shortcake has Green Eyes in the 2009 incarnation.\n My Little Pony: Equestria Girls: Sunset Shimmer is a rare antagonist version of this trope. By My Little Pony: Equestria Girls \u0096 Rainbow Rocks she joins the heroes, fitting the common use of it.\n Betty Boop's usual black hair is colored red and her eyes green in her one and only colored cartoon, \"Poor Cinderella\". Now a days her eyes are still usually a light green but her hair continues to be it's original black.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Real Life\u00a0\n Male example: Probably the most significant figure of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was Genghis Khan, who was described as having red hair and green eyes. Those traits are actually more common than you'd expect in Central Asia.\n\n\n", "Anime & Manga": {"Panzer World Galient": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient", "The Twelve

We barely have enough budget to reuse old Special Effects!\n\"I just wanna get it on record that using force fields for doors in a space prison... is a bad idea. You know what would have been better? Regular doors, with locks! Locks that don't open when the POWER goes out!\"\n\u2014 Space Warden!Cave Johnson, Portal 2\nA standard way to bar entry or exit for characters in Speculative Fiction is to use a Force Field Door. It may be made of Some Kind of Force Field, glowing bars of Pure Energy, concentric Instant Runes, or what have you. If touched, it may harmlessly shock or dematerialize the appendage doing the touching. Sometimes, especially if the field is invisible until touched, it leads to amusing situations where characters run face first into the field.\nAside from Rule of Cool, the advantage of such a setup is usually that it is immune to physical attack, or that it can contain Starfish Aliens that could phase or shape-shift their way through ordinary doors.\nOf course, the flaw in this immaterial marvel is it usually requires an outside energy source, or can be interfered with by using powerful ECM or MCMnote\u00a0Magic Counter Measures). So the hero can traipse past these obstacles by pulling the proverbial plug on it. Worse is when the outside energy source is on the outside of the Force Field Door, making disabling it as easy as beating up some guards and blowing it upnote\u00a0(Which may actually be a challenge if guarded by Elite Mooks or the like). Or blowing a hole in the wall on the side, whichever is easiest. For some reason, the jailers rarely use physical doors outside the field (or wrapped in the field) as a backup in case of power failure.\nIf the force field door is on every side of a room, then it's like a Force Field Cage, which redirects to this trope.\nThis item is available for purchase thanks to Trope Co.\u00ae.\n\nExamples:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0open/close all folders\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comic Books\u00a0\n In Legionnaires #22, the Planet Hell prison has force field doors on the cells. When the Legion and Workforce get locked up by the escaped prisoners, Karate Kid is able to find a weak point in the field, which shorts it out when struck.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Films \u2014 Animated\u00a0\n Monsters vs. Aliens: Gallaxhar puts Ginormica in a force field cage... which she then tears apart with her bare hands! Makes sense, as she is full of Unobtainium, which is more powerful than anything Gallaxhar has.\n Titan A.E.: Cale is thrown into one of these energy jails by the Drej (whose use of them is Justified: everything they build is made of force fields). It seems inescapable, until Cale realizes that the Drej phase through their own energy barriers all the time, and manages to work out how to do it himself.\n Likewise, the cell blocks in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. So naturally, when the city's power grid goes down, so do the \"bars\" in the cells.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Films \u2014 Live-Action\u00a0\n Nightlife, a 1980s vampire TV movie starring Mirriam D'abo and Ben Cross, featured a doctor jury rigging a prison cell for a vampire by hanging ultraviolet lamps above the only doorway into a room, as well as on the ceiling a few feet down the hall in either direction. If the vampire crossed the beam, he burst into flames. See it here.\n Star Wars had several, most notably the barrier that forces Obi Wan and Darth Maul to wait momentarily before their battle.\n Just about every large starship in Star Wars has some part of the hull, usually a hangar, that's open to the vacuum of space. How do crew members breath and not get sucked out into the void? Force fields.note\u00a0On the other hand, this is only implied in canon. It's otherwise Rule of Cool.\n And they do apparently have physical doors as a backup: a Trade Federation battleship gets its shield generators blown up, and immediately closes physical doors over the hangar. The hangers are kept open normally so that in an emergency the starfighter squadrons can be launched at a moment's notice rather than having to wait for the doors to open.\n The cell doors in TRON are beams of energy. Admittedly, they are already in the computer system and everything is energy, but there are still solid objects.\n In Star Trek: Generations, Soran protected his missile launch site with a massive force field wall. Unfortunately, it didn't penetrate the ground, which allowed Picard to bypass it through a tight rock arch it happened to rest on. Also an inversion, as Soran is the one inside the force field.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Literature\u00a0\n Robert A. Heinlein's Have Space Suit \u0096 Will Travel. When Kip and Peewee are on the planet Lanador they find a People Zoo with several persons held behind force field doors.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Live-Action TV\u00a0\n Stargate Atlantis:\n Atlantis has one built into its Stargate, serving the same function as the Iris on Earth's Stargate, with the extra advantage that it can't be overheated by firing exotic weapons through the Stargate (something Earth's Iris has had to deal with).\n The city also has holding cells with energy shields covering actual bars. Surprising coming from the Ancients, who were usually very self-confident (case in point, a force field is the only thing holding the air inside Atlantis when it's in space).\n Stargate SG-1 once features an interesting variant \u2014 a prison cell that uses the force of gravity as its \"Force-Field Door\". The cell is a long corridor with a dead end hooked up to an Artificial Gravity generator. When this is turned on, the end of the corridor becomes the floor of a deep pit, thus preventing escape for anyone inside (and ensuring a painful landing for an unprepared prisoner). When turned off, the \"pit\" becomes a corridor again, and guards can walk in or out. The resulting perspective shifts allowed for nice little Camera Tricks. The flaw is the same as that of any Force-Field Door: cut the power, and the prisoner can simply walk out.\n Star Trek:\n Cell doors in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine are energy fields.\n One Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"We'll Always Have Paris\" had the bar variant in Dr. Manheim's lab.\n Odo from Deep Space Nine had to be held in a room surrounded entirely with force fields, to keep him from escaping in his liquid form.\n Add Star Trek: The Original Series, e.g. \"Assignment Earth\".\n Star Trek: Voyager (in general a frequent offender with this trope) actually has an episode in which Voyager is temporarily converted into a Prison Ship, transporting a large number of dangerous alien prisoners in a converted cargo bay. Of course, all the cells added to the bay have Force-Field Doors. Predictably, a Standard Starship Scuffle ensues, and, lo and behold, the very first victim of Subsystem Damage is the cargo bay's power... The Oh Crap! expressions on the bridge crew's faces when they learn of this are priceless. \"Oh, woe, if only there was some other way we could have locked up those prisoners!\"\n Star Trek: Enterprise, being set in the 'verse's past, is the exception and has a good old-fashioned solid door for their brig, made out of some reinforced transparent material. It seems to work just as well as the force-field doors on all the later Enterprises...\n In the Firefly episode The Train Job, in the intro, Mal is thrown through what is evidently a force-field window: it vanishes as he passes through it, before reappearing a moment later. Assuming it performs the actual function of a window (keeping outside air out, and inside air in), it's most certainly an example of this trope, but they're never seen again.\n In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Skye has to visit a Boxed Crook (former agent Grant Ward) in a cell with one of these. It can go opaque or soundproof at the push of a button. Skye lampshades one of the problems with this trope when she makes absolutely sure that there's no button she can push to accidentally turn it off.\n Space: 1999. The episode \"The Metamorph\" has a classic Force-Field Door for the prison cell on the planet Psychon. Normally invisible, it emits a brief flash that stun the prisoners when touched.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tabletop Games\u00a0\n Dungeons & Dragons:\n Adventure S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. The spaceship's police headquarters had cells with 3 normal walls and one force field wall.\n D&D in general likes its magical force wall/cage effects. Depending on the edition, though, this can be justified in that those don't actually depend on an external power source and can be effectively indestructible if the exact right countermeasures aren't at hand, making permanent versions potentially actually superior to mundane physical barriers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Video Games\u00a0\n These appear in Batman: Arkham Asylum. They must be turned off before Bats can go further.\n These show up occasionally in the Crash Bandicoot series of games. Typically in the Warp Rooms, barring off access to later chambers until you clear the one before it.\n In Half-Life 2 some of the obstacles included energy fields to which you needed to shut off the power to get past. Often by literally pulling out a (inexplicably large) wall plug. These fields also allow combine troops (and trains) though while preventing Gordon and his rebel friends access.\n In Metroid games, doors are, with one exception, surrounded by force fields. These are always Color-Coded for Your Convenience and thus a Broken Bridge till you collect the right upgrade.\n The Prime series actually justifies the door-shields: the door were set up to separate distinct areas from each other. The doors are actually motion-activated, opening when a sufficiently large life-form approaches it, but to prevent the doors opening and closing ceaselessly for the indigenous life, the force-field was set up, which could only be deactivated by an energy weapon from a sufficiently advanced species. It wasn't so much to keep people in and out of certain areas (though that's inevitably what they do...to Samus), but rather to prevent wear and tear from constantly opening and closing.\n In Knights of the Old Republic 2, the Exile, Atton, and Kreia find themselves in force cages repeatedly, which Atton lampshades.\n Both games feature quite a few force field cages and doors. Some of these require you have certain members in your party before you can pass through them (e.g Jolee to get down to the Lower Shadowlands on Kashyyyk).\n In Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon Dahn and his rogue Fukoshi are imprisoned in one. The \"forcefield\" can't be seen through, but the unoccupied cells in the same room have backup bars. (The forcefield is in place to block their insect summoning whistles.)\n In Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, one mission involves escaping from a prison where an enemy has thrown Jayden. Each prison cell has four walls but no doors. The ceiling is a force field. Smart design, considering most people can't jump that high. Not smart when you put a Jedi (who can jump that high) in one of these cells and then let him out to play the most dangerous game with him.\n Common in the Ratchet & Clank series. Sometimes Ratchet (or Clank) has to step on a button to open them, sometimes he has to trick or persuade some other character to step on the button, and sometimes he has to destroy the mechanism.\n The Fallout series has multiple kinds of forcefields.\n Shows up a lot in the modern Sonic the Hedgehog games. They usually require you to flip a switch or destroy an encounter's worth of enemies to drop them. Other puzzles revolve around activating these to use as a walkway and sometimes even navigating mazes made entirely of them.\n In Superhero League of Hoboken, Dr Entropy protects his first dastardly device behind a force field... but while the generator is placed on the inside, its power cord is plugged into an outlet on the outside, allowing the heroes to disable the field with one swift pull.\n In the Perpetual Testing Initiative for Portal 2, an alternate Cave Johnson learns the hard way why these things are bad idea on a Prison Ship\u2014especially when you consider power outages.\nCave: Man, those blue force fields looked good, though. Every time I saw one, I thought, \"Wow! I am in space.\" Still, though...A door made out of paper would have been better in the long run. Would have at least slowed 'em down for a second.\n Unreal I has them all over, as well the consequences of turning off the power...\n Warframe features these heavily on both Corpus and Grineer ships. The former will deplete your shields, and fling you away from the door, as if you were struck by a shockwave, and need to be disabled by shooting (or staying out of sight of) security cameras, and the latter will proc Magnetic damage on you, draining all of your shields and energy, and are disabled by shooting ID scanner over the doorframe.\n Dishonored has force fields (called Walls of Light) that zap to ash anyone/thing unauthorized that tries to go through them. There are plenty of ways to circumvent them, however; there's usually an alternate entrance, you can remove the power source, you can rewire them to let you through and obliterate guards, and you can just throw stuff through the field until it runs out of power. One particular odd form of the latter is summoning a swarm of rats and guiding them into the wall. Two expensive ways to get through them involve Demonic Possession of a guard who is authorized and hop across that way, and the other is to use the advanced version of Bend Time to literally stop time and cross without fear of being zapped.\n In Arcanum,  Arronax was captured by Big Bad and kept in a magical force field capsule barely lagrer than his body for two thousand years.\n A standard in Warcraft III, turning these off is often a matter of killing the generator of boss powering them.\n PlanetSide 2 uses forcefields in lieu of doors. Every base has impenetrable shields around the spawn building; at large facilities, these can be taken out by blowing up the generator that powers the spawn tubes. Other uses of shields are to protect vehicle garages - which often have the generator on the outside - or to delay attackers from capturing the base's control point. Planetside 1 used far more reasonable physical doors for pretty much every situation, only using force fields doors for the vehicle gateways in facility walls.\n The Castles Of Doctor Creep has the Force Field as one of the many obstacles you face. It is impossble to move through a force field (your character will stop just short of touching it), but on the flip side it will block a shot from the Ray Gun. By default, all force fields are on; the only way to shut a force field off is to press a corresponding button. However, the button will only shut the force field off for eight seconds; once time is up, the force field(s) that the button shut off will reactivate.\n XCOM: Enemy Unknown has the aliens use force-fields for their doors and protection for their Elerium engines which the Humans incorporate into their own design.\n Dark Souls features magic barriers that bar the Chosen Undead from entering the Duke's Archives, the lower section of the Tomb of the Giants and the section of the Demon Ruins just before Lost Izalith until they acquire the Lordvessel and place it at Firelink Altar. Similar barriers will also serve to isolate a character within a certain area if they're being invaded or have entered another player's world.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Webcomics\u00a0\n Quentyn Quinn, Space Ranger (an IN SPACE! spinoff from Tales of the Questor): during an arc skewering Star Trek, the main character is placed in a cell guarded by a force field and discovers he's been furnished with a replicator that can produce any food or drink he wishes. (Something the actual Trek examples didn't have, by the by.) He fabricates a glass of water and shorts out the door. You can see it here.\n In El Goonish Shive, Raven considers it \"standard lockdown procedure\" to put up force fields sealing off all the doors and some of the hallways when his school is under a magical threat. Not that it stops Abraham, however.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Web Original\u00a0\n The College Humor: Troopers episode \"Forcefield\" has two bungling prison guards trying to convince their Pincess Leia-Expy prisoner that yes, her cell entrance is still blocked by an invisible forcefield.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Western Animation\u00a0\n The supervillain prisons in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes! use this kind of door.\n In the DuckTales episode \"Armstrong\", Armstrong sticks Scrooge and Gyro in a closet, behind a force field.\n The cells on Peridot's ships in Steven Universe are of this kind, and they temporarily vaporize Ruby's hand when she touches it. Only one thing they didn't account on- the cells are only designed to hold the projected Gem bodies.

No, really.\n Considering that atoms are mostly empty space, and only feel solid due to the strong negative charge present on their surface (such that it is) which repels other atoms in a similar manner to what happens when you try to touch the south poles of two magnets together, ordinary doors are technically examples of this trope. Subverted in that you're just as much force-field as they.\n\n\n", "Live-Action TV": {"Star Trek: The Next Generation": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration", "Star Trek: Enterprise": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise", "Space: 1999": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Space1999", "Stargate Atlantis": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis", "Star Trek": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek", "Star Trek: The Original Series": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries", "Stargate SG-1": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1", "Firefly": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly", "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD", "Star Trek: Voyager": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager"}, "Video Games": {"Metroid": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid", "Warcraft III": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII", "Superhero League of Hoboken": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperheroLeagueOfHoboken", "Ratchet & Clank": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank", "PlanetSide": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide", "Half-Life 2": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2", "Arcanum": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Arcanum", "Dark Souls": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls", "XCOM: Enemy Unknown": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown", "Crash Bandicoot": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CrashBandicoot", "Warframe": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe", "Batman: Arkham Asylum": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum", "Fallout": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout", "Portal 2": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2", "Unreal I": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealI", "The Castles Of Doctor Creep": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCastlesOfDoctorCreep", "Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga", "Dishonored": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored"}, "Web Original": {"College Humor": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor"}, "Films \u2014 Live-Action": {"Star Wars": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars", "Star Trek: Generations": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations", "TRON": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron"}, "Films \u2014 Animated": {"Titan A.E.": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanAE", "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyTheSpiritsWithin", "Monsters vs. Aliens": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersVsAliens"}, "Western Animation": {"Steven Universe": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse", "The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes", "DuckTales": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales"}, "Comic Books": {"Legionnaires": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuperHeroes"}, "Tabletop Games": {"Dungeons & Dragons": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons"}}, "3": {"Webcomics": {"Freakwatch": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Freakwatch", "Jack": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JackDavidHopkins"}, "title": "Horror Host -

This eerie character first appeared on radio serials, creating continuity between otherwise unrelated stories. They then spread to horror comics, most notably EC Comics titles like Tales from the Crypt. Soon they appeared in movies, and then television.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, a horde of Horror Hosts haunted television viewers across North America. There were hundreds of local presenters on low-budget shows based around cheap B-Movies. Sometimes, the host trope was used to tie together otherwise unrelated material into a single episode for broadcast. By the 1980s, the genre had nearly died out completely \u2014 possibly due in part to changing audience tastes, but more likely due to general cost-cutting that resulted in the end of most locally-produced non-news programming in favor of syndicated fare.\nThe Horror Host often takes a sadistic glee in the events of the story, and cannot resist making the implication that the reader might meet a similarly dire fate. He may become an Interactive Narrator, but is usually content to stay at home, whether it be a tomb, a featureless void hung with paintings, or a broom closet with a cardboard coffin. The Horror Host may be grotesque in some manner, possibly with a backstory of his or her own, but ultimately most Horror Hosts are presenters, not protagonists. Their personalities are revealed in various skits, often featuring Black Comedy, morbid props, and puns. These asides usually comment on the themes and morals featured in the episode, making this an example of a Framing Device.\nInstead of a Nightmare Fuel Station Attendant, the presenter may be The Stoic, and remain aloof. The one thing they won't be is scared.\nIn a Live Action TV context, the Horror Host is often the mock-sinister antithesis of the Excited Kids' Show Host. More recently, this character has been fictionalized, appearing as a 'type' in films and movies, or being parodied by characters within a show, often as the introduction to a Halloween Episode.\n\nExamples\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0open/close all folders\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comic Books\u00a0\n The Ur-Example in comics wasn't technically horror. The pioneering crime comic series Crime Does Not Pay featured a character called \"Mr. Crime\", a ghoulish spectre in a \"CRIME\"-emblazoned top hat who sometimes acted as a gloating narrator for the stories, and sometimes directly intervened to tempt the villains to worse acts.\n EC Comics was probably the Trope Maker, at least for comic books:\n The Crypt-Keeper in Tales from the Crypt (and its Live-Action Adaptation Tales from the Crypt and its Animated Adaptation Tales from the Crypt Keeper.)\n The Vault-Keeper in Vault of Horror.\n The Old Witch in The Haunt of Fear\n Drusilla, the silent but beautiful \"lost GhouLunatic\" who co-hosted Vault of Horror alongside The Vault-Keeper for the last four issues of its run.\n Examples from DC Comics, most of whom went on to be supporting characters in The Sandman:\n Cain and Abel in House of Mystery and House of Secrets\n Lucien in Tales of Ghost Castle.\n Destiny in Weird Mystery Tales\n Cynthia, Mildred, and Mordred, The Three Witches, in The Witching Hour\n Eve in Secrets of Sinister House and later Weird Mystery Tales\n The Mad Mod Witch in The Unexpected.\n Judge Quentin Gallows in The Unexpected (who wasn't used by Neil Gaiman, but did appear as an antagonist in a Len Wein story within the Spin-Off series, The Dreaming)\n Charity in Forbidden Tales From Dark Mansion (who also wasn't used by Gaiman, but did go on to appear in James Robinson's Starman)\n Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (see below) was the licensed host of House of Mystery in The '80s (no, she didn't appear in The Sandman either.)\n Death (not to be confused with Dream's sister from The Sandman) hosted Weird War Tales, usually in the form of a skeletal soldier or The Grim Reaper.\n Squire Shade, who briefly hosted Ghosts, was visually identical to the DC supervillain known as the Gentleman Ghost.\n Warren Publishing's black and white comics magazines had several:\n Uncle Creepy in Creepy\n Cousin Eerie in Eerie\n Vampirella for the first eight issues of Vampirella, after which she was reinvented as a lead character.\n From Britain's 2000 AD:\n Judge Dredd character Judge Edwina Strange in \"Judge Edwina's Strange Cases\"\n Henry Dubble in \"Tales of the Black Museum\"\n Sabrina the Teenage Witch briefly served as an EC-style Horror Host in the 1972-1974 Archie Comics series Chilling Adventures in Sorcery As Told By Sabrina. It was actually pretty strong stuff for Comics Code-approved material in its day, and especially for Archie Comics \u2014 straight-up horror, albeit still drawn in the Archie house style.\n The short-lived 1969-1970 magazine Web of Horror (published by Major Publications, best known for Cracked) was hosted by Webster the spider.\n Marvel Comics had a few:\n Headstone P. Gravely (alongside his cohort, Roderick \"Digger\" Krupp) hosted stories in Tower of Shadows and other titles.\n None other than Stan Lee himself served as a \"fill-in\" host for Headstone P. Gravely for a story in ''Chamber of Darkness''.\n Captain America, of all people, could be considered one, albeit only on a technicality. The last two issues of his Golden Age title were retitled Captain America's Weird Tales, because horror was selling and superheroes weren't. Cap didn't actually introduce any stories \"on panel,\" though. In issue #74, he appeared in a regular Captain America story (albeit one with horror aspects, as he fought the Red Skull in, literally, Hell.) He didn't appear in #75 at all, except in the title.\n Charlton Comics had an especially large and colorful stable of Horror Hosts:\n Impy the Imp, a tiny ghost in an all-white costume, hosted Haunted.\n Dr. M.T. Graves (usually just \"Dr. Graves\") hosted stories in several titles, including The Many Ghosts of Dr. Graves. A heroic ghost hunter, Dr. Graves sometimes starred in stories of his own.\n Mr. I.M. Dedd of Ghostly Tales, despite his horns and pale blue skin, was rather dashing and handsome by the standards of Horror Hosts.\n Baroness R.H. Von Bludd, an Expy of Vampirella, was a beautiful redhead vampire who hosted Scary Tales.\n Professor Cyrus Coffin hosted Midnight Tales with his lovely niece Arachne.\n Winnie the Witch was a beautiful young woman with deep blue skin and a penchant for \"mod\" fashion. She hosted Ghost Manor.\n Baron Weirwulf hosted Baron Weirwulf's Haunted Library.\n Even more obscure Charlton Horror Hosts include Mr. Bones, Colonel Whiteshroud, the Old Witch, Mr. Dee Munn, and Mortimer Tishin.\n Dr. Death, the cadaver-like host of This Magazine is Haunted, a series published by Fawcett Comics and then Charlton Comics (which purchased most of Fawcett's properties when Fawcett got out of the comics business), in the 1950s.\n Jack Kirby had Horror Hosts for his series in the abortive \"Speak-Out\" line of adult-targeted magazines that he created for DC Comics in the early 1970s:\n Dr. E. Leopold Maas, a parapsychologist, was the host for Spirit World, which featured tales of the paranormal.\n In The Days Of The Mob featured Real Life stories about gangsters such as Al Capone. But its host, Warden Fry, nevertheless qualifies for this trope, because he's literally the warden of Hell.\n More recently, the horror comic, Bela Lugosi's Tales From The Grave, published by Monsterverse, features the legendary actor himself (back from the grave!) as its host, alongside beautiful vampire groupie, Nosferina, and Hugo, a deformed dwarf.\n IDW Publishing's book of pre-code horror comic reprints called Haunted Horror is hosted by two all new hosts: Forelock The Warlock and Mr. Karswell.\n Trailer Park of Terror has the lovely Norma spin her tales from the titular trailer park.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Film\u00a0\n Boris Karloff hosted Black Sabbath as an unhinged version of himself. He also starred in the second of the featured short films.\n Fright Night (1985). Peter Vincent was the host of the Show Within a Show with the same title, which consisted of him introducing horror movies to his TV audience.\n The Creeper from Creepshow 2 qualifies, although he barely showed up in the first film.\n Gremlins 2: The New Batch featured an in-universe horror host named Grandpa Fred (whose look was lifted directly from Grandpa Munster) who hosted Z-grade horror movies at Clamp Cable. When the plot starts to pick up momentum, he teams up with an excitable Japanese(ish) cameraman to report on the activities within the building and keep the outside world informed.\n Dr. Francis B. Gr\u00f6ss, the narrator/host of the infamous Shockumentary Faces of Death. Like the film itself, \"Dr. Gr\u00f6ss\" had a number of imitators. In the Faces of Death series itself, Dr. Gr\u00f6ss was succeeded by \"Dr. Louis Flellis,\" who claimed (in separate installments) to have accidentally killed Dr. Gr\u00f6ss on the operating table, or that Dr. Gr\u00f6ss committed suicide after having been driven insane by witnessing so much death.\n Brain Damage, the mascot of Brain Damage Films. A few of their releases have an intro by him, and in them he's played by company founder Darrin Ramage. As an example, here's the one for Terror Toons.\n A 1986 horror film called Terror Vision features an in-universe busty horror host called \"Medusa\" who perfectly fits the Gorgeous Gorgon trope.\n Balan from Murder Collection V.1, a Genre Throwback to the shockumentaries mentioned above.\n Plan 9 from Outer Space has Criswell addressing the audience directly and introducing them to \"the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space.\"\n In Body Bags, John Carpenter plays an oddball character with creepy fixation with the dead called The Coroner. He brings the viewers three tales centered around the cadavers in his care.\n The 2005 film The Roost uses this as its actual Framing Device, with its primary tale presented as a weekly Frightmare Theater! episode. It's introduced by a creepy bald butler from a cheesy cardboard Haunted House set, where he badmouths the Bat out of Hell main story and deadpans terrible puns.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Live Action TV\u00a0\n Big Chuck and Li'l John\n Elvira, Mistress of the Darknote\u00a0Who is technically a parody of horror hosts.\n Ghoulardi, who spawned The Ghoul, The Cool Ghoul, Son of Ghoul, and Paul Thomas Anderson.\n Marvin\n Svengoolie\n Vampira, the 1950s Los Angeles inspiration for Elvira also infamous for her appearance in Plan 9 from Outer Space.\n Zacherley\n Rod Serling was one of the rare examples of The Stoic host on TV, in both The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery.\n SCTV's Count Floyd was a Horror Host parody. In-Universe, he was Floyd Robertson, co-anchor of SCTV News, who moonlighted as the host of Monster Chiller Horror Theater.\n Washington, D.C. station WDCA-20 had Count Gore DeVol hosting Creature Feature from 1973 to 1987. Played by Dick Dyszel, who also appeared as the Spock-eared alien Excited Kids' Show Host Captain 20 in the daytime.\n In the TV series Freddy's Nightmares Freddy Krueger himself served as host. This includes episodes where he pulled double duty by starring as the Monster of the Week, giving the impression that he's Reminiscing About Your Victims before the viewer.\n Mystery Science Theater 3000 provides an unusual take on the trope, as Joel Robinson/Mike Nelson and the bots might be considered unusually genial Horror Hosts, while Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank could be considered more typically sinister Horror Hosts of the Show Within a Show that the Satellite residents are forced to watch.\n Off Beat Cinema has three laid-back Beatnik horror hosts, who are less sinister and more into \"digging it.\"\n The Hunger had two of these, one for each season. Terence Stamp did the honors for Season One. Season Two went further by casting David Bowie (who had a key role in the movie that inspired the show) as an original character: Mad Artist Julian Priest. Unusually for a Horror Host, his backstory is complicated enough that the first episode of the season (\"Sanctuary\") is devoted to telling it, so he doesn't address the viewer until the final sequence. Subsequent episodes use traditional bookends as he muses over the themes of the stories in question, with touches of Black Humor here and there. He's rather elegant and melancholy for a horror host too, but that only makes his sadistic (and sometimes masochistic) moments all the more unnerving.\n The Munsters features an episode with a fictional Horror Host named Zombo, who, to Eddie's disappointment, isn't a blood-thirsty ghoul outside of his television show.\n Balrok and No Name, effectively a pair of frat boy demons, are two newer examples of B-movie horror hosts with the San Francisco-based Creepy KOFY Movie Time. Besides running a public domain film each week and making the usual variety of jokes about it, their host segments feature a house band, some scantily-clad lovelies, chats with contemporary B-movie makers, and a guest stand-up comedian, making for a goofy Variety Show.\n Salem the cat was a horror host during certain Halloween episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.\n TNT Monster Vision's Joe Bob Briggs.\n Alfred Hitchcock himself provided the hosting duties for the eponymous Alfred Hitchcock Presents, airing from 1955 to 1965 on CBS and NBC. Hitch's macabre drollery and frequent use of props such as guillotines and gallows makes him a classic Horror Host, and colorized footage of his introductions were used in a 1985 posthumous revival.\n Roald Dahl presented the first two series of Tales of the Unexpected. His quiet, avuncular manner and comfortable surroundings (overstuffed armchair, cozy fire, knit cardigans) usually managed to make the audience feel more disturbed, thanks to the contrast between his introductions and the bizarre stories that usually followed.\n Boris Karloff's tenure on Thriller.\n Detroit's equivalent was Count Scary (Tom Ryan), a standard Bela Lugosi-type vampire who not only hosted occasional horror films, but starred in local comedy specials as well.\n Discontinued Canadian horror channel \"SCREAM\" had several horror hosts. Mistress Olga was a goth/vampire/dominatrix who hosted monster movies, Tiff was a Dumb Blonde cheerleader who hosted slasher movies and Nancy was a British schoolgirl who hosted supernatural and occult movies. They were all played by the same actress, Jane Meikle.\n Several two-parters of the television adaptations of the Goosebumps were given intros and outros hosted by the books' writer, R.L. Stine himself, with Cryptkeeper-esque jokes and puns, but mixed with stoic Rod Serling-esque delivery. For unknown reasons these were abandoned after season two.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pinball\u00a0\n The Crypt Keeper in Data East Pinball's Tales from the Crypt, naturally.\n Played with in Scared Stiff, insomuch as Elvira is the hostess to the player as they watch (and play) various horror movies together.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Puppet Shows\u00a0\n Parodied with Dr Phil van Neuter and Mulch, who presented the recurring Muppets Tonight sketch \"Tales from the Vet\".\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Radio\u00a0\n Raymond of The Inner Sanctum, he of the creaking door, Hurricane Of Puns, and final wish of \"Pleasant dreeeams?\" Often bantered with his Mandatory Plug co-host, the Lipton Tea Lady.\n The Mysterious Traveler, voiced by Maurice Tarplin, who told his stories on a train.\n The Strange Dr Weird, also voiced by Maurice Tarplin, and who was based in \"the house on the other side of the cemetery\".\n The Man In Black, voiced by Valentine Dyall in The BBC's Appointment With Fear and The Movie The Man In Black. And by Mark Gatiss in The Remake of the radio series The Man In Black.\n The Whistler of the same show, known for his eerie whistled theme tune and always having one last twist revealed in The Stinger.\n The Shadow started out as the host of a crime-drama series, but became a character in his own right when audiences found him more interesting than the stories that unfolded. Not strictly a horror host, but his voice was chilling.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Webcomics\u00a0\n Every now and then, a somewhat creepy storyteller-narrator character appears on Jack to tell disturbing stories. He often gives his own thoughts while the story is in progress. At the end of the last arc to feature him in that role, he revealed  that he was in hell and so is the reader.\n Theodore Tremaine was a daytime newscaster for a local TV station on weekdays.

Most common are sandwich trucks and taco truck (see Cuisines in America for details).\n This practice is also becoming common in Britain, normally as a sideline run by a local cafe. More elaborate setups offering hotdogs, burgers etc cooked while you wait tend to be found in lay-bys, the parking lots of retail parks or dotted around pedestrianised shopping areas.

Food quality ranges from unspectacular but perfectly edible to Orgasmically Delicious.\n There are also the ever-famous food carts, which typically stay in one place on the sidewalk all day, but can be moved very easily to follow traffic patterns; these are common in cities around the world, but are particularly common on the East Coast of the US, and most especially in New York, where they are practically a religion.\n Bookmobiles, or mobile libraries as they're known in Britain.\n There are companies out there that will wash your car and/or repair windshields on the spot (well in the parking lot anyway)\n Ice cream trucks.\n Also old-time cigarette girls.\n Most of the alleged doctors in the Wild West would travel by wagon from town to town selling a 'miracle elixir' said to cure whatever ailment they could come up with.

If they have limbs, they tend towards tentacles or wings rather than arms and legs. May attack using special eye-related attacks such as petrifying gaze or Eye Beams. Because of the symbolism between disembodied eyes and evil, creatures like this are more often evil than not.

After reluctantly wearing the super sensory (but embarrassing looking) new eyes her mother made, Jenny exploits its weakness by kicking sand into the eye... which it then humorously subdues itself by picking up all the wrong things to help the burning (hot sauce, a magnifying glass, and a pointy stick).\n In Gravity Falls, Ford studied \"eye-bats\", which are literally giant eyeballs with bat wings.\n\n\n", "Anime & Manga": {"Bastard": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bastard", "Tokko": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Tokko", "Monster Rancher":

To make things more convenient, sometimes every time they switch channels they find a new aspect of the story being covered, so that this random succession of sound bites adds up to a fairly cohesive television article.\nFor example, Bob the jewel thief watches the news triumphantly:\nReporter: \"Russian Police are baffled after the mysterious disappearance of the Hungarian crown jewels.\"\nBob switches channels.\nNew reporter: \"The jewels, on loan to the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, were supposedly protected by a five-million-ruble security system.\"\nBob switches again.\nYet another reporter: \"However, at nine o'clock this morning, museum curator Dmitri Chukraj was alarmed to discover that the entire display had somehow been replaced with some Reese's Pieces and a rubber chicken.\"\nAnd so forth. It's sometimes parodied by having him turn to a channel that normally wouldn't have the news - a cartoon channel, or MTV - and yet it's still talking about it. Another common gag is to have the different reports literally Finishing Each Other's Sentences or answering each other's questions. Expect a news-phobic Apathetic Citizen to stop flipping immediately if they do manage to find anything else on.\nMakes varying degrees of sense; when the story is about, say, a nuclear threat on the White House, you'd expect nothing less. But when it's something like a chimp loose on the freeway, it starts to get dubious. And even if it is important, flipping through channels never gives repeat information, even though it's highly unlikely that each broadcast started at the exact same time and covered all the points in the exact same order. Plus eventually you have to get to some shopping channel or college/school billboard or public access channel which would never break their format (or even have the ability) to report anything at all. Nevermind the fact that the various news channels are watching each other's broadcasts, and therefore information on breaking developments doesn't stay exclusive for long.\nThis trope has for all intents and purposes replaced the Spinning Paper montage, which in movies of the thirties, forties and fifties was used to this effect by having the story appear as the front page of every major newspaper.\nSee also Coincidental Broadcast, Worst News Judgment Ever, or Your Television Hates You for the non-news version. See Do Not Adjust Your Set if some interloper is replacing normal broadcasts with its message. The basic idea is Truth in Television.\n\nExamples\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0open/close all folders\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anime and Manga \u00a0\n Justified in Black Cat, after the Big Bad kills more or less every major world leader in one day. No one is talking about anything else, obviously.\n The third part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has an interesting variant that combines this trope with Coincidental Broadcast. Joseph's stand gives him a clairvoyant ability when used in conjunction with certain objects: when he uses this on a television, the channel begins flipping rapidly, and the resultant melding of words from different speakers ends up spelling out a new message that gives the information he wants.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comic Books \u00a0\n While not an exact montage, in Watchmen, Ozymandias sees the effect of a disaster by watching multiple news channels simultaneously and getting the message that has been sent.\n Same thing in Kingdom Come, with Superman watching multiple reports of the Kansas disaster in the Fortress of Solitude.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Film \u00a0\n Sent up in Shaun of the Dead. Mildly subverted in that only every other channel was showing the news and covering the story, while the other channels conveniently filled in the blanks in the sentences with unrelated statements. Eg:\n Channel 4 News Anchor: Though no one official is prepared to comment, religious groups are calling it Judgement Day. There's...\n The Smiths: ...Panic on the streets of London...\n ITV News Anchor: ...as an increasing number of reports of...\n Football Commentator: ...serious attacks on...\n Channel Five News Anchor: ...people, who are literally being...\n Narrator of a Wildlife Documentary: ...eaten alive.\n A much creepier variation occurs later in Shaun of the Dead: the characters turn on a TV to find out the news, and every single channel is only showing a Technical Difficulties card.\n At the end of the film, the same sort of montage selects various programmes showing the uses tamed zombies are put to once the apocalypse wears off. The Sky News anchor is shown giving his horrified reaction to breaking the news and telling people what to do if attacked by zombies.\n Several times in Scream (1996)\n The trope appears in Speed, when Howard Payne is watching several news channels at once, all covering the runaway bus. He muses, after detonating a secondary bomb and watching the reactions, \"Interactive TV, Jack! The wave of the future, eh?\"\n Also done in The People Vs Larry Flynt. Flynt, with multiple TVs, turns them all on to different channels, and when he finds out they're all focused on what's going on at his house, lets out a war whoop of joy.\n Another based-on-fact film, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, has this when he is suffering his infamous octuple heart attack in Los Angeles in 1964; back in England his mother is delighted to find out that he is sufficiently famous that there are reports on his condition on both the BBC and ITV at once.\n Cars has a montage covering Lightning McQueen's disappearance, including a tiny Kei car with huge anime-esque eyes jabbering in Japanese, and an appearance by Jay Limo.\n Crocodile Dundee 3 has this straight up. Mick is on the freeway when he spots a \"cat\" next to the road. He stops to pick it up, causing traffic to stop. Then people start speculating what is happening, until someone misunderstands and thinks its a bomb. The police and bomb squad show up, only to find Mick carrying a skunk towards them. When he gets home, he turns on the TV to find himself the news. Desperately trying to hide his guilt, he turns half a dozen TV channels, all covering this same story. Finally, he turns off the TV, exclaiming nothing good is on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Literature \u00a0\n In Ben Elton's book Popcorn, a set of serial killers reveal to their hostages that their situation is on every channel on TV. Except for one channel showing The Simpsons, which is seamlessly dropped in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Live Action TV \u00a0\n This happens frequently on the new Doctor Who series. During episodes where aliens or creatures attempt to invade Earth, fictional news broadcasts (usually BBC News) will be shown explaining the situation and worldwide reaction to the event. In the episode \"Army of Ghosts\", the Doctor is shown at one point flipping through TV channels, which are all devoted in some way to the regular appearances of the ghosts \u2014 not just on the news, but on talk shows, T-shirts, and even EastEnders. Similarly, in \"Aliens of London\", the crashed spaceship is the hot topic on all news channels, and also Blue Peter (which is showing kids how to make a model of it). This happened as recently as the episode \"The Sontaran Strategem\".\n Subverted in the episode \"The Sound of Drums\", where the Master flicks through various channels reporting on the upcoming First Contact, before finally settling down to watch Teletubbies.\n Played for laughs in Saturday Night Live, in a skit where Bill Clinton, in bed with Hillary, tries desperately to find a news channel that is not discussing his sex scandal. No hope for him though, as even the weather report manages to weasel it in.\n Used in the pilot of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip where every news channel is covering the show's producer's outburst on live TV about the crappy state of today's television landscape. It actually uses this to mock the quick formation of memes as every single reporter independently latches onto an analogy to the famous \"I'm mad as hell\" scene from Network.\n Inverted in the British comedy Broken News, which is based on someone supposedly flipping between 24-hour news channels, all of which are showing different stories, and the amusement comes from the start of one story feeding into a different one as the channel is changed.\n Subverted in Being Human: Cutler tries to do this to show the elder vampires how the world is scared about werewolves. Sadly for him, it's been covered up, leading to flipping through a variety of unrelated TV shows to his annoyance and frustration.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Newspaper Comics \u00a0\n In a FoxTrot comic from the mid-1990s, every channel is covering the O. J. Simpson trial, except for one that briefly diverts to mention a UFO landing on the White House lawn.\n In the strip from the day of the 1992 election, Jason is watching TV and every channel is about to say who the winner of the election is. Jason panics and keeps flipping until he finds a channel showing an episode of Star Trek, and breathes a sigh of relief.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Video Games \u00a0\n In Starcraft II, this is the method Matt Horner uses to bring Jim Raynor up to speed on the Zerg invasion. Of course, when you have an event like this where billions of people are being killed, it ought to be on every station. The flipping itself is justified in at least one case, where a sudden explosion kills the news crew and cuts off the signal.\n Played with in Command & Conquer: Generals's Expansion Zero Hour. It's intro is played in this style, however each and every single one of the reports in full is actually part of the plot, serving as Exposition for the game's storyline, with one reporter on each side.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Web Original\u00a0\n This brilliant promo for a Bob Dylan compilation lets you flip through 16 channels at your leisure, from news to reality TV to fake movies, and on every show the performers are simultaneously miming along to \"Like A Rolling Stone\".\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Western Animation \u00a0\n Happens in a few DuckTales episodes:\n In A Case of Mistaken Secret Identity, several talk shows are seen speculating on Gizmoduck's true identity.\n In The Masked Mallard, several networks are covering the Masked Mallard's having turned to crime.\n Was sent up in The Simpsons episode \"Radioactive Man\", where the channel breaks occur every syllable: \"Ev\"-\"er\"-\"y\"-\"one\"-\"is\"-\"tal\"-\"king\"-\"a\"-\"bout\"-\"Ra\"-\"di\"-\"o\"-\"act\"-\"ive\"-\"man\"-\"y'all.\"\n Used also in \"Homer Bad Man\" where, inexplicably, Homer allegedly touching a babysitter's butt is national news on every channel and Movie Of The Week fodder. You know things are bad when even Channel Ocho is having a field day at your expense.\n A version of this was seen on The Weekenders, where Tish, angry that her friends have started using her name as a slang word, flips through the channels and discovers that every channel has some reference to \"Tishing\". (An advertiser is heard to say \"It's Tishtastic!\")\n Garfield and Friends had an episode where Jon was trying to watch TV, and every single channel was showing the movie Kung Fu Creatures On The Rampage 2.\n The Powerpuff Girls Movie: While walking home from school, the titular girls stop in front of an electronics store and see several TVs, each on a different channel but all covering similar stories about them destroying Townsville. Shortly after they walk away, every TV switches to the same emergency broadcast of Professor Utonium being thrown in jail.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Real Life \u00a0\n Events such as the 1991 Gulf War, the attacks of September 11th, 2001, the transit bombings in London, England on July 7th, 2005, the Sandy Hook shooting, the Paris attacks of November 13th 2015, or the OJ Simpson trial - just try finding a channel that isn't covering it, and for hours on end at that.\n The July 7th bomb attacks on the London Underground (and one bus) provided an especially evocative example: Matrix signs over the motorways heading into the city simply stated, \"PULL OVER. TURN ON RADIO\".\n In fact, the afternoon after the 9/11 attacks, parents were warned not to let their children watch TV because of how widespread the coverage was. To be fair, this was back when the major networks used to actually have children's programming blocks on weekday afternoons (and of course, much of PBS's normal daytime programming is comprised of educational, children's programming of the likes of Sesame Street and Barney & Friends - as described under No-Hoper Repeat, most of PBS' affiliates switched to 24/7 kids' shows for the week after the attacks).\n The same goes for a Presidential address (shown live) in the US.\n Also watch in your own city in the event of severe weather. You'll notice every local station with a newscast in your city broadcasting continuous information about the ongoing tornado, hurricane, etc...\n In a few rare cases, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, it can be a national story as well.\n Also played straight after the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013: all of Boston's major network affiliates preempted a large amount of programming to provide local coverage of the aftermath. It went even further during the manhunt of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, when the networks offered national coverage throughout the day, including the final moments of the manhunt of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (which conveniently took place in primetime).\n It also had side effects in Canada, as several television providers (particularly Bell) source their U.S. east coast network feeds from Boston (some providers alternatively use Buffalo, Detroit, and/or Rochester instead)\u2014but rights to 75% of U.S. network shows are also held by Canadian networks, and they will typically play along with U.S. preemptions to ensure they can get the valuable \"simsubs\" that keep them afloat.\n There are plenty of less-than-important stories that get wall-to-wall coverage as well. In fact, less-than-important stories seem to get more wall-to-wall coverage than important ones.\n This came with the rise of round-the-clock news coverage. They have hours of news to fill, so they tend to repeat themselves quite a bit. Shows with sensationalist leanings, such as Nancy Grace, are even worse; that woman can get a solid six month's worth of shows out of one news event.\n Supposedly, the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal literally took up about 1.5 times as much screen time as every other news story combined when it was the big story.\n The death of Michael Jackson became a \"too true\" example of a single story dominating several stations at once, and far beyond the expected 24-Hour News Networks. The night of his death, NBC, ABC, and CBS scrapped most of their prime time schedules for tribute shows/news coverage. (Fox stuck with a So You Think You Can Dance live show, but there was a tribute to him at the top of the program. A few days later, Fox aired a rerun of an American Idol episode from the past season that was themed around Michael Jackson songs.) Music video channels, even Network Decay victims like MTV, flooded the airwaves with loops of his videos. All in all, the coverage of his death, memorial service, etc. took up almost a month of round the clock coverage, even ignoring major global events like the revolts in Iran and a coup in Latin America.\n The deaths of Princess Diana and most recently Robin Williams also come to mind.\n At least in the United States, there will always be some channels which probably wouldn't change their programming even at The End of the World as We Know It. The Cartoon Network is going to show their cartoons, the Food Channel is going to be baking a cake, and Sesame Street is going to sing a song about sharing. That said, if something really serious goes down, the Emergency Alert System would take over all the TVs. That said, 9/11 proved a rare exception; the coverage was so widespread in fact, that a lot of the kids' networks such as CN deliberately didn't change their schedules so kids would have something safe to watch. Meanwhile, the Food Network broadcast a memorial graphic and nothing else. The attacks didn't alter the Street, but a storyline was aired about a fire at Hooper's Store about a year afterward. (Arthur had a similar storyline.) A lot of networks (especially networks that broadcast nothing but pre-recorded shows) were operated completely automatically back then. The only person on site might have been a lone security guard. It never occurred to the owners that there could be a national emergency serious enough to affect broadcasting but not serious enough for broadcasting not to matter. Nowadays most networks have at least one operator on duty in Master Control whenever they're on air for this exact reason.\n Speaking of emergency broadcasting, while a national emergency such as 9/11 was the kind of event \u2014 short of a nuclear war \u2014 that the Emergency Alert/Broadcast System was created for, the EAS administrators decided not to issue an Emergency Action Alert (which would have compelled all broadcasters to transmit important news and information on the emergency at the demand of the government) because they quickly realized they would be redundant and counter-productive \u2014 the broadcast networks and nearly every TV station of any type (as mentioned above, barring some kids' channels) had all already shifted to a round-the clock coverage of the attacks, and the EAS system could only carry audio simulcast from a radio station (thus, making it easier for the President to speak directly to the media instead)\n Anything to do with The Pope is serious business due to his international prominence as leader of the Catholic faith, and if anything significant that happens to the Pope\u2014especially if they step down (Pope Benedict XVI) or die (Pope John Paul II), every channel will cover the reaction and (if necessary) the funeral. Then the news channels begin to hype up the conclave by profiling every papal candidate, putting up a picture-in-picture camera of the smoke stack on the Sistine Chapel, and debating what color the smoke is. When the decision is made, every network promptly drops everything again.\n\n\n", "Video Games": {"Starcraft II": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII", "Command & Conquer: Generals": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals"}, "Web Original": {}, "Live Action TV": {"Saturday Night Live": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive", "Teletubbies": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies", "Doctor Who": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "Being Human": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK"}, "Real Life": {"Robin Williams": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams", "The Pope": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope", "PBS": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS", "Michael Jackson": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson"}, "Comic Books": {"Watchmen": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen", "Kingdom Come": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome"}, "Newspaper Comics": {"Star Trek": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek", "FoxTrot": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot"}, "Film": {"Speed": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed", "Shaun of the Dead": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead", "Scream (1996)": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996", "The People Vs Larry Flynt": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePeopleVsLarryFlynt", "Cars": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars"}}, "7": {"Western Animation": {"The Fairly OddParents": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents", "The Rugrats Movie": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRugratsMovie", "Family Guy": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy"}, "title": "Tinkle in the Eye - TV Tropes", "Anime and Manga": {"Kyo Kara Maoh!": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh", "Akkan Baby": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkkanBaby", "Tenchi Muyo!": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo", "Sailor Moon": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon", "InuYasha": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha"}, "text": "\n \n Those protective goggles are really handy!\nI still don't like changing diapers, but ever since Hammie came along my reflexes have really improved.\n\u2014Daryl MacPherson, Baby Blues\n\nAny time Hilarity Ensues because someone without experience is taking care of a baby, you can expect the writers to bring out the horrible and dreaded act of The Diaper Change for quick and easy Toilet Humour.

Original Video Animation.\n Occurs in the Rurouni Kenshin anime when Kenshin, Sanosuke and Yahiko inadvertently blunder into the ladies side when they're a bit too excited to share an Eureka Moment. Sano and Yahiko go down in one hit, while Kenshin manages to dodge the first, only to take the second in the face.\n Zoe Ornimoto from Digimon Frontier did it\nVideo Games\n Persona 4: when the male characters stumble upon the female characters in the hot springs, the latter continuously throw a ridiculously amount of wooden buckets at the former. No amount of Courage the main character can have to be able to \"hold the line\".\n This gets a Call Back in Persona 4: Arena where one of random items what Teddie can throw causes washtubs to rain down like a meteor shower.\nWeb Comics\n In Megatokyo in a public bath, Piro hears Miho and Yuki screaming and rushes to their aid.

Compare with Go for the Eye and Sniping the Cockpit.\n\nExamples:\nAction Game\n Not a playable example, but an actual cutscene. In Bionic Commando 2009, Radd Spencer is gripped by Joe's mecha and nearly crushed to death. He regains consciousness in time to headbutt through Joe's windshield, through the heavy-reinforced glass, and through Joe's face. This causes the robot's hands to free him.\n Poison Ivy in Batman: Arkham Asylum. This one is odd, considering she's inside a plant.\n In the sequel, Batman: Arkham City, you have to do this with Mr Freeze.\n Mechwarrior has this trope in the form of the cockpit hitbox location. However despite the fact that it has minimal armor and a powerful shot can in fact instakill any mech if you hit it the small size and difficulty of hitting it even under the best of conditions makes it almost universally a lucky shot if you pull it off.\n Crosses over directly with Go for the Eye against an Atlas; the cockpit is in its right eye!\n The first fight with Agnus in Devil May Cry 4 is this. He sits behind an electrified glass wall and you must break through it by chucking flying swords at it.\n Abductors in Freedom Wars have giant \"pods\" on their bodies, the destruction of which will deal heavy damage to the Abductor (as well as liberating whoever is trapped inside). Be careful, though: once the pod is broken, the Abductor Turns Red.\nBeat 'em Up\n Averted in the old Punisher beat'em up game - The robot boss has some glass panels in its head but those go first and breaking them is no impediment - you have to literally punch the thing into scrap to win (It somewhat resembles the car-wrecking bonus stage in Street Fighter II - the thing keeps losing more and more parts as you beat it up.)\n In The Ninja Warriors Again, the Final Boss, the evil dictator you're supposed to kill, is in a laser-spamming machine with a glass window. And there are loads of minions attacking you!  You have to throw the minions into the glass to damage it until it breaks.\n Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time for the SNES gives you this in your first boss fight against Shredder, who's in a mechanical construct firing all sorts of weapons at you while his Foot Soldiers are distracting you (and the battle is shown from Shredder's point of view). While you can beat up the ninjas endlessly, the only way to beat Shredder is to throw said ninjas into the screen.\nPlatform Game\n Various bosses in both Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. In fact almost every robotic boss in each game is subject to this.\n In Pac-Man World 2 Inky, Pinky and Clyde are all defeated this way.\n Pinky's mech is an odd example. The glass cockpit is coded to be a weak point, but you can't actually attack said cockpit without hacking (you're supposed to attack a different weak point), yet the glass dome continues to depress and crack anyway.\n The final boss of the original Mario vs. Donkey Kong.\n The brain-powered psychic tank in Psychonauts is defeated by flinging chunks of concrete at the glass dome shielding the boss's brain.\n The Sonic the Hedgehog series has many bosses defeated in this manner:\n The Egg Viper from Sonic Adventure.\n Every GUN mech from Sonic Adventure 2.\n All of the day bosses from Sonic Unleashed. And the Egg Dragoon too.\n The final bosses in Sonic Spinball and Sonic Colors.\n Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island had this for all of the end of level battles with Robotnik.\n Pretty much every boss fight where you fight Eggman directly. You'd think he'd learn by now.\n Mother Brain from Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. Super Missiles are needed to break the glass, which still fails to kill her. Also the same with Mecha Ridley.\n In Flintstones - The Rescue of Dino and Hoppy, you have to defeat the final boss by breaking its cockpit cover made of glass.\n In Super Methane Bros, the three intermediate bosses can only be destroyed by repeated hits to their glass cockpits.\n Inverted in Earthworm Jim, which has a level where you have to carefully guide an underwater vehicle around. More cracks appear in the glass every time you hit a wall. Oh, and there's a time limit.\n Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril: The Final Boss battle with the Supermech.\n Captain Syrup's flying saucer, which serves as the Factory Final Boss in Wario Land II, has a crystal cockpit which you need to break with body slams so you can throw the bombs she launches back directly at her.\n Dr. Weil's final form in Mega Man Zero 4 has an orange pane of glass protecting his head. Break it and he blows up.\nRoleplay\n The first hostile entity in Destroy The Godmodder had a cracked glass cockpit. Despite being pretty big, it got curbstomped after the weakness was revealed.\nRole-Playing Game\n In Knights of the Old Republic, the key to defeating the final boss is shattering containers with prisoners, from which he keeps leeching life to heal himself.\n More Elite Mook than boss fight (although they are treated as boss enemies the first few times they appear), Atlas mechs in Mass Effect 3 are a variation of this trope: they have glass cockpits which you can break and then kill the engineer piloting it so you can hijack the mech and pilot it yourself, using it to kill the rest of the Cerberus troops. While cool, this turns out to be Awesome, but Impractical, since, by the time you manage to break the glass, the mech will probably be on the brink of death anyway (and if the Atlas mech is destroyed while you're in it, you get a Game Over); it's simpler to just destroy it outright.\n\n", "title": "In Case of Boss Fight, Break Glass - TV Tropes"}, "10": {"Webcomics": {"Agents of the Realm": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AgentsOfTheRealm", "Roommates": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Roommates"}, "Literature": {"Septimus Heap": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap", "The Seventh Tower": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSeventhTower", "Doctrine of Labyrinths": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctrineOfLabyrinths", "A Discovery of Witches": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADiscoveryOfWitches", "A Song of Ice and Fire": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire", "Safehold": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold", "Words of Radiance": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WordsOfRadiance", "The Giver": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGiver", "Dune": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune", "Tamora Pierce": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce", "Mara, Daughter of the Nile": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaraDaughterOfTheNile", "Elegy for a Demon Lover": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNecromanticMysteriesOfKyleMurchisonBooth", "The Shadow Speaker": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowSpeaker", "Galaxy of Fear": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear", "The Belgariad": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad", "Orson Scott Card": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard", "Journey to Chaos": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos", "Matthew Swift": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MatthewSwift", "Mercedes Lackey": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey"}, "title": "Occult Blue Eyes - TV Tropes", "text": "\n\n ...yikes...\nThese blue eyes indicate a character who either is demonic or possesses the \"evil eye\", magic, or witchcraft. In Mediterranean countries, this comes from the Demon's Eye amulet, which is always blue.

But when opened, are revealed to be blue with YELLOW whites! Kamo only appeared in chapters 1 and 2.\n Yu-Gi-Oh! has season 4's Atlantean villain Dartz depicted with one yellow eye and one blue eye. The Orichalcos had infected him and changed one of his eyes from yellow to blue. In real life yellow is the unnatural eye colour whilst blue is very common but then again this is anime. The Orichalcos stones are blue and much of Dartz's attire consists of blue as well to hammer home this trope.\n Additionally, there is Kisara from season 5. She is exiled from most civilization because she has pale skin and blue eyes (very unusual for Egypt at that time), and is believed to be a witch. They aren't exactly wrong;  her ka is the Blue-Eyes White Dragon, the most powerful one not possessed by one of the six priests.\n Norway from Axis Powers Hetalia, mixed with Creepy Blue Eyes, though sometimes they're coloured purple.

She is also a powerful witch by heritage, but prefers to bury herself in academia and Renaissance history.

According to the in-universe science, the whites turning blue (known as \"eyes of Ibad\") is a normal biological reaction of humans exposed to spice. However, spice also as some psychoactive effects and gives psionic abilities to at least some humans, which links the two together in people's minds. While most people have to consume large doses of spice for their eyes to change color, it's so omnipresent on Arrakis, the planet which produces it that every native has this effect to one degree or another.\n Blue eyes are considered automatically creepy, for this reason, in Empire Of The Petal Throne.\n In Galaxy of Fear, Tash is blue eyed, which goes with her Force-Sensitivity and appearance as a Creepy Child who knows too much. When she meets Luke Skywalker and senses their Commonality Connection, she feels like his blue eyes are piercing and see more than they should.\n Having blue eyes, or at least light as opposed to dark, is very rare in the community in which The Giver is set and seems to be a sign that one is capable of \"seeing beyond\".\n In Mercedes Lackey's Heralds of Valdemar series, any powerful magic user is going to wind up with blue eyes regardless of what they were born with as a side effect from the amount of magic they use.
