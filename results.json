This tends to be less noticeable than its female counterpart because exclusively (or near-exclusively) male casts are already common and expected (thought not always with the intentional appeal to females) and the fanservice tends to be along the lines of "he cooks" or "naked chest" and thus usually objectifies in a different way than in male-oriented shows\u2014unless there are Yaoi Guys involved. The writers sometimes leave it to their audience to retrofit the standard group of friends into the Unwanted Harem if they wish.\nSome series of this flavor go the reverse harem route and have an ordinary female lead among the Pretty Boys as an audience surrogate, although the girly keet type can be used this way too.\nSometimes these stories have their own version of Those Two Guys. One will be a \'normal\' audience surrogate and thus a young (but non-threatening) girl. Another will be a more \'ideal\' woman, often a clever, sexy, and mature lady who barely fits into her dress.\nCompare and contrast Improbably Female Cast, Otokonoko Genre.\n\nExamples:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anime & Manga\xa0\n Free! has a cast that, by far, only consists of five attractive and well built male swimmers.\n And season 2 introduces a new set of pretty boys in addition to the old cast.\n It should be noted that this is a common trope for many sports related anime. Haikyuu!! and Kuroko no Basuke are also good examples of this trope.\n Most of the guys in Durarara!! could qualify. There are exceptions, but most of the male cast is rather pretty.\n Black Butler takes this to Up to Eleven levels. Nearly every damn single male character is an outright bishounen, with few exceptions. There are a few female characters, but most of them are either one arc wonders, dead, or only recurring. Or they\'re there to fangirl over the hotness of our protagonist, Sebastian.\n Jump ahead to the school arc of the manga. Ciel enrolls into an all boy\'s school and nary a woman is to be seen. What few women do show up are unimportant background characters with little to say and zero fanservice to provide any male readers who didn\'t abandon the series after season 2 of the anime. We do however get a large new cast of attractive teen boys.\n Several CLAMP series, especially Clamp School Detectives, X1999 and Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.\n Amatsuki: Plenty of good-looking male characters for the fans to enjoy, both human and non-human. The artist lampshaded this by doing a Gender Flip chapter special without changing the guys\' faces.\n In the 2013 The Anime of the Game Amnesia (Otome), the entire plot revolves around a group of simply gorgeous young men, all of whom are interested in the heroine.\n Axis Powers Hetalia. All of the main characters, the Axis 3 and the 5 Allies, are young men. The main reason for this? The author has trouble drawing women. Ironically, many of the main characters were initially meant to be middle-aged. The first and most prominent female character is Hungary, who appears in the center of the volume 5 cover. It\'s probably not a coincidence that\'s she\'s a fujoshi. She is not the female audience surrogate, however; Seychelles was made for that purpose.\n Beyblade and its Spin-Off Metal Fight Beyblade has a rather disproportionate amount of pretty underage boys for a show about spinning tops, most likely to attract girls who otherwise wouldn\'t have given the show\'s premise a second thought.\n Black Blood Brothers proves that being hot and being a vampire are not exclusive.\n When the werewolf big guy is a Bishonen, you are definitely here.\n Black Cat: Filled to the brim with good lookin\' guys. You can count the non-pretty characters on one hand, and none of them are prominent.\n Although Chrono Crusade has quite a bit of fanservice based around its mostly female True Companions, it\'s not hard to notice that every single important male character is very good looking, and these characters probably have as many Shirtless Scenes as the girls have Clothing Damage scenes, if not more. Obviously, the manga-ka knew how to widen his demographic.\n Descendants of Darkness: The average female character has the life expectancy of a particularly stupid gnat or falls off the face of the earth after one or two appearances, and only one major character is not bishonen. And we should be glad: apparently Ukyou (Muraki\'s consensual Love Interest) actually appears in a short the author did at the publisher\'s request, and turned out to be a mystic trouble magnet with so much trauma she\'s afraid of all men and some kind of growth deficiency so she looks like a little girl. Not what the references to her led us to expect.\n Fruits Basket, while having several plot-worthy female characters other than the lead in the manga, spends a disproportionate amount of its time on Yuki and Kyo. The rest of the cast is also heavily bishonen. Also see Harem Genre.\n Fushigi Yuugi has them littered everywhere. Miaka, the main character, has a personal harem of them. Yui gets Nakago, and Nakago gets... everybody else, at some point or another in the story.\n Also in the "shounen manga for girls" category, Get Backers dishes up plenty of Fanservice in the form of scantily clad women with impossibly huge boobs, the series still appeals to some girls who are attracted by the predominantly bishounen cast.\n Gravitation, Gakuen Heaven, and any other Boys Love series.\n Taken to a ridiculous extreme in Sukisho. There are no female characters in the entire show, and all characters are either bishonen, handsome men in their 30s, or young boys, and one crossdresser housewife. There is one single woman in the background who is visible for about half a second, and one character mentions his mother in one scene.\n Similarly occurs in the Saint Beast prequel series. There are no women in heaven apparently\u2014those pretty youths with female names? Male. Rei too.\n Togainu no Chi: All Igura participants are male; all of them. In fact, the city of Toshima seems to have no female inhabitants.\n Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is considered a Cast Full of Pretty Boys among its female audience, despite the fact that it is not only a shounen series, but has a deliberate 1:1 ratio of male to female main characters and more or less assigns one female to each male.\n Hana-Kimi is about a girl disguising herself as a man so she can get into an all-boys school. Obviously, most of the cast are bishounen.\n Hunter \xd7 Hunter. There\'s so few women per story arc that you can count them on one hand.\n That said, there tends to be a wide variety of character types with only a handful of bishonen among them, and sometimes it\'s really hard to tell which characters are which gender.\n Except for a few deliberately ugly characters, Parts 4, 5, and 7 of JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure are full of very feminine/androgynous male characters. (Part 6 takes place in a women\'s prison). Part 2 is more like a Cast Full of Shirtless Hunks.\n Karneval: Most of the male cast could qualify.\n Shonen Jump title Katekyo Hitman Reborn! has Tsuna and his guardians. Plus the side characters. Plus 99% of the villains. In fact, the number of times there is fanservice for guys can be counted on one hand.\n Kimi to Boku centers on a group of bishounen childhood friends, especially the twins Yuki and Yuta.\n Kyo Kara Maoh!, complete with Those Two Girls: the flirty curvy ex-Maou Cheri and the younger inventor Anasina, sometimes joined by a trio of servants who are essentially fangirls themselves. (They write yaoi fanfic about their employers!)\n Yuuri even has an Unwanted Harem, and he\'s actually engaged to one of them! He pretty steadfastly ignores it, though he also gets visible man-crushes on at least one, possibly two pretty guys.\n 95% of La Corda d\'Oro\'s main characters are male and pretty.\n Love Mode: Nothing but good-looking guys.\n Junjou Romantica. Understandable, since it\'s a BL series.\n Les Mis\xe9rables: Sh\u014djo Cosette has almost all of The Friends of the ABC. The exceptions are Grantaire and Lesgle, but their appearance was upgraded.\n Nabari no Ou: Every major and minor male character under 30 is Bish\u014dnen. No exceptions.\n Ouran High School Host Club plays with this, along with Haruhi\'s crossdressing letting girls gush over her too.\n Pandora Hearts is a textbook example of this.\n Papuwa has only one human female character, and she\'s... Let\'s just say she is six feet tall, over muscled, and has a beard. The rest of the cast are animals and attractive men.\n Peacemaker Kurogane: Most of the cast is male and Bish\u014dnen and Ho Yay is rampant. The only identifiable females are Saya and Susumu\'s sister.\n Pr\xe9tear, created entirely on the premise of combining a Magical Girl anime with a male Unwanted Harem. Even if a few of them are far too young to be bishonen yet, they are clearly meant to be bishonen in training and before the series started, they * were* bishonen until they were killed by the villain.\n It\'s very easy to confuse The Prince of Tennis for a Boys Love series due to its largely male cast and mostly Yaoi Fangirl following. Actually it\'s a shonen manga and anime, however, it\'s a very fine example of the increasingly prevalent Bishonen Jump Syndrome (and what a surprise, Prince of Tennis happens to be serialized in Shounen Jump).\n Ronin Warriors, wherein maybe two of the main characters are women, and every male is prettier than you or your girlfriend.\n Arguably, Masami Kurumada as the author of Saint Seiya popularized this. After all, who else would have the guts to name a man Aphrodite?\n His next big work, B\'t X is even more into this trope. Because as vaguely homoerotic as it was when Shun revived Hyoga by cuddling up to him, nothing surpasses the bishieness of Demon Knight Sapphire. Because really, he himself says he\'s really into "what\'s hot and what\'s not" and goes so far as to kiss Teppei.\n Fou and Quattro\u2014 born in Sodom, died in Sodom!\n CLAMP started off drawing Saint Seiya doujinshi (there\'s still some of it online, I think) and the fandom actually consolidated the use of the word \'yaoi\' in the 80s. It also has only one instance of female fanservice in the entire thing (although this is not so in Next Dimension)-compared to the amount of times we see Shiryu shirtless and Saga naked...it\'s certainly one of the best examples of this trope.\n Saiyuki: The basic series premise is not \'A loose retelling of Journey to the West.\' It\'s \'Throw three hot guys and their cute surrogate little brother in a small jeep and watch the fireworks.\' The only significant female characters are Lirin and Yaone. Yaone was added in to increase the number of girls and in one volume a note from Minekura at the end states: "There are no women in this volume, I looked back and found a couple of pages with Kannon." As for Kanzeon? Close but no cigar.\n Saiunkoku Monogatari has the heroine making friends with dozens of gorgeous Long Haired Pretty Boys. If there\'s one thing to be said about the series, it\'s that it\'s very, very pretty.\n Since it\'s by the woman who practically invented Yaoi, Toward the Terra already had a fair share of pretty boys in manga form. Then someone decided to adapt it into an anime and put Nobuteru Y\u016bki (aka, the man responsible for the bishonen overload in Vision of Escaflowne) in charge of the character designs. The end result is that there are simply no ugly men in this series. At all.\n Every speaking male in Tokyo Mew Mew is on eye candy. Take your arguably Stripperiffic Teen Genius, your amazing dessert chef with the red sports car, your murderous alien, or your perfect boyfriend. Were we supposed to be watching the show for strong female characters or environmentalism? Hmm...\n Trigun borders on this, as almost all of the major male characters are attractive bishonen, including Vash, Knives, Wolfwood, Legato, etc.\n It also has Those Two Girls, in the form of Meryl and Millie, though neither of them does the curvaceous thing. One-shot characters handle that. Like the Stripperific engineer, Miss Elizabeth, and the undercover sheriff, Miss Aurelie.\n Vampire Doll: All of the men are gorgeous flamboyant eyecandy who lay on heavy fanservice. What few girls in the series are adorable too.\n Vampire Knight: While it has its female characters, the cast is predominantly made up of very pretty boys. Even the headmaster could be considered bishonen.\n Not even The Vision of Escaflowne escapes this treatment. Though Van isn\'t super girly he is still very handsome; Allen, on the other hand....\n The Wallflower: Each member of the unwanted harem is a liberal user of Bishie Sparkle.\n Wei\xdf Kreuz: Arguably the biggest draw despite its poor animation quality and plot holes large enough to drive a tank through, its four angsty, sexually ambiguous bishonen have garnered a wide fandom.\n Marvel Comics has made several attempts to court manga readers, both Japanese and Western. Their latest attempt is OEL X-Men Shoujo manga entitled X-Men: Misfits. In this manga, Kitty Pryde, the Audience Surrogate character, is the first female to enroll at Xavier\'s for a very long time and thus surrounded by an Unwanted Harem composed entirely of bishonen. Poor Kitty. Submitted for your horror and/or squee; the Hellfire Club. Other exhibits include Bishie Iceman, Bishie Nightcrawler and Not-So-Bishie Bishie Wolverine (who looks like Bill Kaulitz!). Also included is Bishie Gambit (at least somewhat justified given Gambit has always been fangirl bait), who apparently is the resident Goth/Industrial fan. Kurt is unusually human-looking in this title.\n As the page quote states, almost all the characters on Yu-Gi-Oh! are men, and most are either feminine or American, sometimes both. The best evidence of this is the Marik\'s Evil Council videos, where all the villains appear in succession, and aside from Zorc and possibly Akun (or Bob), ALL of them are incredibly bishonen. It\'s even more obvious in the other two. Latter has emphasis on the Ghetto.\n YuYu Hakusho is another great example: while the central True Companions gender ratio is almost 50/50, the focus is overwhelmingly on guys, many of whom are quite Bishounen. The big exception is Kuwabara, but damn if he doesn\'t make up for that with his great physique! This was not at all the case back when the premise was \'dead delinquent having heart-warming yet hilarious ghostly adventures\', when the main characters were Yusuke and Botan, with Keiko and then Kuwabara becoming increasingly important, and also Shota who appeared twice and Sayaka the ghost girl who joined up for a while.\n 07-Ghost main cast has only males, with only a few women on the side. Not only that, but every male character who isn\'t a geezer is *fabulous* , and good looks are apparently required to be a bishop. Then there\'s all the rampant Ho Yay...\n The only female characters in any given episode of Miracle Train are Akari and the Passenger of The Week.\n Almost the same applies to Marginal Prince (where the character design comes from the same person as the series above): the only reoccuring female characters are relatives of the main characters (sisters or mothers) and all of them are faceless.\n Corsair\'s cast, with the exception of Barbossa is very much this, plus Aura and Katarina to fill the beautiful women quota. Seen here. There\'s a reason for this.\n Betrayal Knows My Name: Every character is a bishonen.\n InuYasha has this in spades. note\xa0If you\'ve been reading The TV Tropes Wiki Drinking Game, take a swig. If the character is central to the plot and male, he will be Bishonen.\n Boys Love Ai no Kusabi due to there being very few women on the planet it takes place and much of the population being the product of LEGO Genetics.\n Number: It\'s easier to list the female characters: two look like four-year-olds  and one of them is the enemy leader; one\'s a Ninja Maid Cold Sniper who might be an artificial human (she\'s certainly treated like one); one\'s a really well-endowed hermaphrodite who killed herself trying to take down an enemy, and her little gal-pal  is actually a boy. There\'s also the main character\'s dead mom and sister.\n The only male characters who aren\'t bishounen are the Number assassins\' corrupt targets (we only see two of them before the plot kicks in) and the ninja-maid\'s master, who\'s a Frank Booth-level sadist (minus the drugs (probably)). The rest of the handsome/pretty cast love to torment the handsome/pretty teenage main protagonist.\n School Teacher has a small classroom of cute/pretty boys who are actually animals trying to become human (tsundere fox, horny rabbit, hyperactive squirrel twins, and very eager-to-please puppy; the puppy thought the teacher was a parrot due to his red hair and later declares that he "will be sensei\'s wife!"). The two exceptions to the all-male cast are  the sexy oujo-sama cat with full lips, long hair, and female kimono who\'s actually a neutered male and the woman who had a crush on his master who only appears in flashback.\n Marginal Prince, it\'s based on a Romance Game after all. In fact, there isn\'t a single reocurring female character except for Yuuta\'s faceless older sister (who serves as an Audience Surrogate ).\n The Legend of Sun Knight. So much so that you could say it feels off when they tone down the copious amount of Bishie Sparkle after the first couple chapters.\n K. Large, almost entirely male cast, all of them pretty.\n Undertaker Riddle. The male/female radio is 1 female for 5 males, all of them pretty.\n Di[e]ce. There\'s only one significant female character. The rest of the cast consists of pretty, pretty Bish\u014dnen.\n In Kamisama Kiss nearly every male in the series is on a sliding scale of attractive that ranges from cute boy lolita to full-on Bishounen. If he isn\'t attractive, he is not plot important.\n In D.N.Angel, if they\'re plot relevant and male, they will be Bish\u014dnen. (Bar Daisuke to some people but he could be considered cute in a Dojikko sort of way.)\n tsuritama is an extremely rare slice-of-life example where every male character have their own unique quirkiness.\n Donten ni Warau, wherein even the army mooks are mostly Bish\u014dnen. Basically, if you have as much as two words to contribute to whatever\'s happening, you will be pretty.\n Star Driver, where basically every single male of the important cast is very, very pretty. Hell, the main character is called Ginga Bish\u014dnen, for crying out loud! You know you\'re there when even the villain, who\'s actually so old that he\'s the hero\'s father, is confused for a hot highschool guy.\n With a 2:1 gender ratio and three of the four male characters being rather attractive humans and a Half-Human Hybrid (the fourth is a bear, though even he may be considered attractive for his species), there\'s no question the cast of Sands of Destruction is full of pretty boys. DVD Bonus Material acknowledges this by making Agan a model, Naja his up-and-coming rival model, and Kyrie an apparently-random choice for the world\'s third-best-looking man (behind Agan and Naja, of course).\n Death Note has quite a few Bishounen in its cast.\n Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE! takes place at an all-boys school, with the main cast being made up entirely out of Ambiguously Gay Bishounen.\n Aruosumente: With only two named female characters, the cast is overwhelmingly male and everyone below the age of fifty and with a name is pretty.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fan Works\xa0\n Most of the male Capricorn Pirates from One Piece: Parallel Works. One reviewer Lampshades this by saying, "All of the Capricorn males are either Bishounen or had the potential to become one - Yes, even Hatori and Thierry."\n The Secret Life Of The Backyard Kids. The girls could be counted on one hand.\n While the characters on South Park look identical aside from their hair and clothes, the vast majority of South Park fanfiction describes its main characters as attractive pretty boys.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Films \u2014 Live-Action\xa0\n The Outsiders had Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, C. Thomas Howell, and Ralph Macchio. All were young, sometimes shirtless, and barely a girl in sight.\n Velvet Goldmine. Very young Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and still young Ewan McGregor and Christian Bale (clad in glitter, makeup and feathers, of course).\n The 2009 Star Trek movie has its cast invoking youth and sex appeal more than other Star Treks while keeping the cast mostly male.\n Most of the men in the movie franchise Twilight would make a woman/man pant, regardless of whether or not they even like the story.\n Interview with the Vampire had young Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater as the main cast. Oh, and Kirsten Dunst.\n The Lord of the Rings movies have a grand total of three female main characters, and almost all the rest are played by very handsome actors.\n Considering the books gave the females even less of a role...\n Subverted in The Hobbit where the prettiest of the cast is reduced by a half, mostly because nearly the rest are playing older dwarves.\n Gattaca, thanks to Designer Babies.\n It doesn\'t take much to see that the cast of The Avengers is eye candy, and there seem to be only two females in the movie that have any part whatsoever. Even the villain is too hot for words.\n Fight Club seems to do this on purpose. It gives the female audience highly attractive men like Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Jared Leto in varying states of undress, a ton of Ho Yay... and then has them violently beat the shit out of each other. If you\'re into that kinda thing you\'ll be in heaven.\n The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones has a ludicrously attractive array of males\u25ca in the cast - the females are pretty too, but there\'s much fewer of them since the movie\'s target audience was teenage girls.\n Les Mis\xe9rables. Seriously, at least half the movie focuses on a whole band of ridiculously attractive young men in a revolutionary fervor and singing gorgeously. And the older guys are played by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Live-Action TV\xa0\n The perpetually angst-ridden, ridiculously good-looking, fanservicey-as-hell (almost entirely) male cast of Supernatural, especially since the show likes to kill off any supporting female character. Combined with the unavoidable Ho Yay, it almost seems as if it is being written solely to appeal to fangirls.\n Every new Kamen Rider series.\n Not just the new ones. A good chunk of the old ones were considered "Showa Hotties" when their series were on.\n At first, in Flashpoint, the only female character on the team was Action Girl Jules. Before Leah joined the team after Lewis Young\'s death. Even Lampshaded the episode when Leah joined and the woman\'s locker room\'s sign was changed from Jules to Women.\n Heroes has about a dozen main characters, all but two of whom are male. And they\'re so pretty...\n In Season 4 of Merlin, Prince Arthur assembles his Knights of the Round Table. Recruitment seems to be based on how very, very pretty they are.\u25ca Also, how drop-dead gorgeous our title character\u25ca is.\n The Warblers in Glee are, for the most part, very hot and very good at singing. And it only becomes more so after Kurt transfers to Dalton.\n All the other hot guys on the show - Finn, Sam, Puck and Mike for starters. Also Will, Sebastian and Joe.\n The Vampire Diaries: The Salvatores, Jeremy, Tyler, Alaric, Klaus and Matt - and that\'s just the main cast!\n Noah\'s Arc: The only man of even average attractiveness in the main cast might be Alex (even that point is debatable), with all the other guys having absolutely perfect physiques.\n Teen Wolf. Those poor, beautiful, beautiful lacrosse players. They can\'t even manage to keep their shirts on for more than ten minutes at a time.\n Friday Night Lights.\n Even the most feminist-leaning seasons of Power Rangers have an almost two-to-one ratio of male to female characters (standard procedure is four male rangers, two female; changes to the formula only lead to fewer females such as the five-to-one Ninja Storm.) This leads to an almost all-male cast of young, good-looking, athletic pretty boys year after year.\n Highlander has this in spades. Duncan, Methos, Richie...many of the baddie immortals aren\'t exactly ugly either. It\'s not an *all* male cast, due to Tessa in season 1 and the recurring Amanda and Dr. Lindsay later on, but it fits. The films have it as well, but the series is more noticeable.\n Skins seemingly uses a very simple recipe for casting: "hot" and "in their late teens" which naturally results in this trope on the male side. Especially present in the third generation, when Nick, Matty, Rich, Rider and Alex can all be counted as pretty boys.\n A number of Korean dramas fit this trope, but particularly Coffee Prince, in which a sexy 30-something rake overhauls a coffee shop by hiring only sexy young men. Of course, one of them is someone he only thinks is a young man.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note\n The main cast of consists of four boys and one girl. While the boys are not exactly bishonen, they are good-looking enough that western viewers of the anime adaptation often wondered the possibility a case of reverse harem (as the girl is The Protagonist). Being a series written for tweens, that is obviously unlikely.\n The spinoff Genie Team G Jiken Note, however, plays this trope the most straight; the male cast\u25ca there is the most bishonen allowed in a Children\'s Literature artwork.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n This trope defines the Japanese talent agency Johnny\'s and Associates.\n Two words: Boy Bands. It doesn\'t even matter if they can play instruments or have talent. If all the members are fairly good looking, they fall under this trope.\n All K-pop boy groups. Don\'t even try to deny it.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pro Wrestling\xa0\n An accusation Delirious threw at Ultimo Dragon\'s Toryumon promotion while he was working for it, one that many people agree with though most of them don\'t find it such a bad thing. This is less true of regional variants such as Dragon Gate USA and Toryumon Mexico, but only slightly.\n Most of the WWE roster, to the point that quite a few wrestlers have even made their pretty looks a part of their gimmick, or given themself a nickname to reflect that they\'re a part of this trope. Examples include "Prince Pretty" Tyler Breeze, "The Shaman of Sexy" John Morrison, and of course "Dashing" Cody Rhodes.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Radio\xa0\n Big Finish\'s \'\'The Confessions Of Dorian Gray\'\'\u25ca (yes that Dorian Gray) manages to pull this off despite it being a sound only medium (which is a great pity)\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n The entire Angelique series. Ditto Kin\'iro no Corda and Harukanaru Toki no Naka de. This is the point of the NeoRomance series.\n Many characters in Inazuma Eleven are this. Some of them even look prettier than the female cast. Of course this applies to the anime as well.\n Nearly every male character in Dynasty Warriors is, if not a downright Bish\u014dnen, rather good-looking, although all of the bishonen are from one of the Three Kingdoms (when they\'re not moonlighting due to game circumstances). Before DW7, Wu had the highest concentration of bishonen; now, Jin takes the crown, seemingly designed to be a Ghetto. Since Samurai Warriors is derived from Dynasty Warriors, it\'s only natural that the trope applies there as well.\n Sengoku Basara, the Capcom rival to Koei\'s Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors, is loaded with lots of male characters, who are things for female players to ogle at. Most of its characters satisfy some kind of fetish, but it\'s usually arguable that guys like Date Masamune, Sanada Yukimura, Mori Motonari and Chosokabe Motochika come out on top of the popularity list.\n The Final Fantasy franchise have always catered to this trope on some level, though only by including one or two "token" bishonen rather than a whole harem. However, Kingdom Hearts relishes coming up with more and more bishonen to throw into the fray, the biggest example being Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts II, in which the villains are a sprawling organization of super-hot men with one token female on the team.\n The all-star fighting game Dissidia: Final Fantasy includes the main hero and villain out of the first ten games in the franchise. This leads to 21 out of 24 male leads. The heroes only have one girl on their side (leaving out Shanttoto, who\'s a bonus character). By default, the game qualifies for this trope just for including Cecil and Kuja in the same cast. The female headcount goes down by one when you realize that Cloud of Darkness is actually genderless and only takes the form of a beautiful woman.\n Final Fantasy XV takes this trope and runs with it, featuring an all-male party that fans have compared to a boy band.\n While Harvest Moon games have the option of playing a female and thus providing a list of eligible bachelors, some of the more recent ones have started slipping in greater amounts of this into the bachelor selection to point where it\'s a Base Breaker amongst fans (as older games had handsome but more realistically "normal" rural men). Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility even includes a guy feminine you can woo him with flowers. Not surprising, as one of the chief complaints of female players was that the roster of wives were significantly better looking and interesting than the grooms. The spinoff Rune Factory and its sequels amps this up: even the main character, who is male, can be considered cuter than one or two of the bachelorettes.\n Rune Factory tends more toward the opposite end of the spectrum, though; more often than not, almost every job in town is done by a cute, single girl (and/or her sadly unmarriable mother). Particularly glaring in Rune Factory Oceans, the first game to feature a female player option at all; Sonia gets four choices for marriage (including Aden), while Aden gets ten. Rune Factory 4, which will be the first to feature a female option from the beginning, looks as though it will end up with a more even pretty boy/pretty girl ratio.\n Meine Liebe follows this trope with unabashed faithfulness, adding plenty of Ho Yay thrown in for good measure.\n The anime was worse, reducing the female character in the games to token appearances.\n Yo-Jin-Bo, being a Romance Game, is all about the bishounen. The only girl who appears onscreen besides yourself is Hatsuhime (who kinda is still you, in a way). A couple of maids may speak during the endings, but they never get to be in the picture.\n Pick an otome game. Any otome game. This trope is the point.\n Touken Ranbu is about bringing famous Japanese swords to life in order to fight an evil force...and all of these swords take on the forms of pretty boys and handsome men.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Animation\xa0\n Parodied in Senpai Club. The titular senpai (bar the one female) are all varying degrees of anime stereotypes such as the Long-Haired Pretty Boy and the keet. The problem is that they\'re drawn in a very simplistic and stylistic way compared to everyone else, who is animesque.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Comics\xa0\n Hanna Is Not a Boy\'s Name has many, many pretty men to suit everyone\'s taste, and a total of two significant female characters (one of whom at first seems like a Villain of the Week). Check out the cast lineup.\n The Dreamer has almost every taste, and only one major female character.\n Noblesse the online manhwa, has hot bishonen aplenty\u2014and they end up living in the same house. Yaoi fangirls, right\u25ca this way.\u25ca\n The Law of Purple frequently displays its prettyboys shirtless.\n Large enough portion of the cast of Roommates are Pretty Boys to qualify despite having several strong women characters who get panel time.\n Black Haze, to a ridiculous extent. Almost every male character, young or even older, is absolutely gorgeous.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Web Original\xa0\n The four main men of Demo Reel. Donnie flirts with everyone and is played by an actor who self-admittedly lives for a sexual attention, Tacoma is in drag for the latter half of the series and is regularly told he looks hot, Karl\'s sexy German accent gets him a foursome at the con, and hunky Quinn is dressed in shirts that show off his muscles. The only female character, Rebecca, is also pretty, but very pointedly not sexualized to get across the message that women are treated like shit in Hollywood.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Western Animation\xa0\n Judging by the many statements and fanworks of the fangirls, Transformers Prime follows this trope.\n Possibly unintentional on the part of its creators, Metalocalypse fits this trope. Dethklok and their manager are all attractive (even Murderface has his offbeat charm) males, the only female characters are extras or, in one case, a recurring villain, and the show is liberally peppered with Ho Yay.\n This was Lampshaded in a season 4 episode where the band goes on vacation to the Middle East and are mistaken for women by absolutely everyone. Even the few guys who believe they\'re men still find them attractive.\n\n\n',

He started in 1955 as Country Boy Calhoun, working various territories. He got the "Haystacks" name after an appearance on Art Linkletter\'s House Party where he demonstrated his strength by tossing bales of hay into a high loft. He competed for many National Wrestling Alliance territories, for New Japan Pro Wrestling, and for WWE, then the WWWF. He was a 1x WWE World Tag Team Champion with Tony Garea, a 1x NWA Tri-State (Mid-South) United States Tag Team Champion with Jack Brisco, and a 2x NWA Canadian (Vancouver) Tag Team Champion with Don Leo Jonathan. He was an early television star and a significant box office draw.As usual, you can find the basics at The Other Wiki. "Country Boy Tropes": Acrofatic: In a sense. He didn\'t do moonsaults or cartwheels, but in a time where every big man\'s gimmick was to basically stand there and let guys run into them, he chose to actually utilize real wrestling moves into his moveset. Big Guy, Little Guy: Played straight with most of his partners. Averted when he teamed with the 600 lbs. Man Mountain Mike. Everything Is Big in Texas: He was from McKinney. Face: Pretty much always, to the point he made a career as a "traveling enforcer" for the various territories. Finishing Move: Big Splash The Giant: 640 pounds, even Sammartino had trouble slamming him. Besides the immovability part of the gimmick though he was pretty versatile. Legacy Character: He paved the way for both future giants such as Andre and future "hillbilly" characters such as Hillbilly Jim and the Godwinns. Martin Ruane, better known as Giant Haystacks/Loch Ness, originally called himself Haystacks Calhoun. There was a late 1990s Florida independent wrestler who called himself Haystacks Calhoun Jr.note\xa0Real name John Brody, he was "Hornswagglin\' Hillbilly" in Juggalo Championship Wrestling. Parts Unknown: "Morgan\'s Corner, AR" Stout Strength: As demonstrated in the TV appearance described above. ',

But look at this boy, he\'s even prettier!"\n\u2014 Ultros (regarding Noel Kreiss), Final Fantasy XIII-2\n\n\n\n\nA popular Asian character type, the bish\u014dnen, or "beautiful boy", is a male character that possesses androgynous or "feminine" physical traits. He is usually tall, slender with almost no fat and little to no muscle, and no body or facial hair. Large, expressive eyes are almost a given, though Tsurime Eyes are also common in more serious examples. In anime, many bish\u014dnen have female voice actors (most comedically, Naruto Uzumaki), although those that don\'t get startlingly deep, sexy voices instead. It is not uncommon for those at the more feminine end to be mistaken for women by other characters, or for savvier examples of the type to take advantage of such an assumption.\nBish\u014dnen can be found equally distributed between heroes and villains; bish\u014dnen villains often develop devoted followings among fans. Bish\u014dnen with white hair are almost always villains, no matter how they initially seem.\nIn the English fandom, the term bish\u014dnen simply connotes "a really, really attractive male", but in its original usage, it refers to a specific type of attractiveness that is found in adolescents. The cutoff for bish\u014dnen in the strict sense is around 20 years old. Beyond this age, the Japanese describe male attractiveness through terms like biseinen or bidanshi ("beautiful man") or ikemen (roughly "good-looking guy"). The affectionate English fandom shorthand "bishie" bypasses the lexical issues somewhat. Examples of both bish\u014dnen and biseinen should be placed on this page. Likely to have drawn on a moe aesthetic when they were younger.\nThe comparable Korean concept is kkot-minam ("flower pretty boy"). The most similar Western type is Pretty Boy.\nThe appearance and behavior of the archetypal bish\u014dnen is often used to explore sexuality and gender norms. Thus, Yaoi Guys have a tendency to be this.\nOriginally, bish\u014dnen characters were the province of shoujo and Boys Love Genres, but since the mid-90s, it has become the default style for teenage boys in pretty much any work looking for a cross-demographic audience. Since more modern anime and manga are overwhelming geared towards appealing to both men and women in this respect, a large majority of virtually all mainstream works will feature at least one bish\u014dnen character, if not more. Also the farther bish\u014dnen characters disseminate from their source genres, the less likely it becomes that there will be in-universe mention of their androgynous looks/attractiveness.\nOlder Than Print, since The Tale of Genji has it in spades. Often comes with the Bishie Sparkle. If all the guys are bish\u014dnen without many women to balance them out, you\'ve got yourself a Cast Full of Pretty Boys.\nRelated to Rule of Glamorous. The Long-Haired Pretty Boy is a standard bish\u014dnen design.\nContrast Gonk, The Grotesque, and Puni Plush. Also contrast Hunk which can nonetheless cross over with this trope, such as for Vega from Street Fighter. Pretty girls are known as Bishoujo ("beautiful girl"), but the esthetics of bishoujo are different, typically emphasizing cute, petite femininity rather than sleek androgyny. See Bifauxnen for ladies who conform a bit more closely to the bish\u014dnen aesthetic.\n\nExamples\nThis is an East Asian media only trope. For pretty boys in other cultures see Pretty Boynote\xa0The difference is primarily cultural, and it is not at all uncommon for Animesque media to use this trope much in the same way as the examples here, but for convenience\'s sake, let\'s just put the Eastern ones here and the Western ones there..\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \nAnime and Manga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are so many examples in anime and manga that they\'re being put in their own section.\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A - H\xa0\n Ai no Kusabi: Everyone but a few minor characters, especially Riki.\n Akira from Ai Ore Love is so bishonen he can pass as a girl, and Even the Guys Want Him. A majority of the men in the series are bishonen.\n In AKIRA, there\'s Kai, aka Kaisuke, who\'s short, slim, well-dressed, girlishly faced, and can knock a guy through a window. Being relatively sensitive and apparently crushing on Kaneda in the manga and Yamagata in the anime, he\'s often perceived as a young homosexual.\n Seiya Kanie and Takaya Kurisu from Amagi Brilliant Park\n Anatolia Story (a.k.a Red River): there are about four male characters in the entire series that don\'t fit this trope. The artwork is Viewer Gender Confusion incarnate.\n A majority of the male cast from Angel Beats!.\n Just about every male character in the OVA for Angels Feather.\n Mei from Arashi No Yoru Ni manages to be this even though he\'s a non-anthro goat.\n Even if Arata Kangatari is aimed at boys, it wouldn\'t be a Watase manga without a few of these. In particular, Yorunami\'s bishiness gets lampshaded by Hinohara.\n Ask Dr. Rin!: Tokiwa, Eddy, and Banri.\n Many characters in Axis Powers Hetalia are actually mislabeled as this (and the fanart doesn\'t help); the art style is very Puni Plush, thus the majority of the male designs are simply moe. The ones that aren\'t moe usually fall more into the hunk category (and even then, there\'s overlap) and there\'s even a few bara-type characters, such as Turkey. The purest bishounen in the series would be Austria.\n Huey Laforet from Baccano! takes this to the point of confusing people in-universe (you know you look girly when one of the prettiest woman in the series is your nigh-identical adult daughter, and you know you look really girly when you are not mistaken for beautiful women, but beautiful women are mistaken for you). Firo, while never being mistaken for a woman like Huey has, has been mocked by a detective in the Light Novels for skewing quite close to the Uke aesthetic. Claire Stanfield, aka. Rail Tracer, also fits. Jacuzzi also fits, although he has that giant tattoo on his face.\n Graham Specter also definitely qualifies\u25ca, even if he is a total psychopath.\n Christopher Shouldered is noted in the books to be quite pretty \u2014 if you can get past the utterly terrifying eyes and teeth.\n Barajou no Kiss: most of the male characters.\n Every main male character in Beauty Pop.\n Griffith from Berserk is explicitly labeled as "too beautiful to be a man" in about a dozen separate chapters by different characters! He even wears lipstick after transforming into Femto.\n Every male character in Betrayal Knows My Name.\n Every male character in Black Bird, but especially Kyo, whom Misao mistakes for a pretty girl upon seeing him as an adult.\n A good amount of the male characters from Black Butler. Except for Baron Kelvin, who realizes this and is obsessed with "becoming beautiful", Georg von Siemens, Jumbo, Lord Arthur Randall, Azzurro Vanel, Fred Aberline, Damian, and Doctor.\n Creed\u25ca from Black Cat. There is also Train\u25ca, Lin Shaolee\u25ca, and Jenos\u25ca.\n Black Lagoon:\n Rotton the Wizard, to an extent. He basically exists just to look cool and talk fancy. Revy even asks him if he\'s a man whore.\n Though still a kid, Garcia\'s beginning to grow into a handsome young man.\n Hansel also shows signs of this. Unfortunately, he didn\'t live long enough to grow into an adult.\n And in an Omake, we see that Sgt. Boris used to look like this; he joined the Army to toughen up. All the "de-aged" girl characters wail that he should stay this way.\n Zen from the manga Blank Slate. He\'s so bishounen, even his blind love interest can tell he\'s handsome just from touching his face.\n Bleach:\n Ayasegawa Yumichika is defined by his connection with beauty. Not only in looks but in lifestyle, too. He even accepted a lower rank in his squad than he had to because he thought that, in kanji, the number 5 was more "beautiful" than 4.\n Byakuya Kuchiki is very bishonen and is often voted "Seireitei\'s Sexiest Male Shinigami" by the Shinigami Women\'s Institute.\n Ukitake, a white-haired Long-Haired Pretty Boy, is almost as bishounen as Byakuya.\n Ishida Uryuu has a very slender, delicate build and an exceptionally fair complexion for a male character. He takes after his father Ryuuken, who is a Silver Fox, and who was his school\'s heartthrob when he was Uryuu\'s age.\n Ichigo is also a bishounen, especially when his hair starts growing.\n Aizen is bishounen.\n In chapter 409, Tensa Zangetsu reveals himself for the first time and he\'s as bishounen as it gets. Yes, even Zangetsu didn\'t escape.\n Also, Szayel Aporro Granz.\n Shukuro Tsukishima.\n Gin. Yes, that Gin. Kubo\'s goal may have been to make him creepy, but a lot of girls viewed him as bishounen instead.\n Muramasa, the Big Bad of the Zanpakuto Strange Tales Arc.\n Ouko Yushima from the Invading Army Arc.\n The end of chapter 670 gives us our young Toshiro Hitsugaya all grown up so he can use the full potential of his Bankai.\n Solomon Goldsmith from Blood+. Can\'t forget tall, dark, and handsome Haji.\n Ema\'s thirteen stepbrothers in Brothers Conflict. Wataru might not count yet, considering the fact that\'s he\'s only 10, but will likely grow into this trope when older.\n Many of the male characters in Chibisan Date.\n Pretty much the entire premise of Boku no Pico.\n Chrono Crusade has a few examples.\n Joshua Christopher is the most obvious example from the series\u2014he\'s quite thin (even implied to look underweight at one point), has pale blond hair and blue eyes, and looks quite a bit like his sister.\n Aion is a bit more borderline\u2014he\'s actually quite muscular when he takes off his Badass Long Coat, but his long, white hair does a lot to give him an edge of androgynous beauty. He\'s maybe a bit more of a biseinen.\n Chrono is a tricky one. In his true form, he\'s a bit rough around the edges and his outfit goes out of the way to highlight his muscular chest, but in his Sleep-Mode Size, he\'s got longer hair and looks much younger (and thus cuter). However, he still has moments of looking quite pretty in his true form, and a flashback in the manga shows him with long hair, which definitely qualifies him.\n Even Claymore manages to have one of these in the cast: Isley of the North.\n All the students in Cluster Edge.\n Corsair: all the men are very pretty, except Barbossa.\n Benten from Cyber City Oedo 808. Yes, he does wear lipstick and paint his nails. No, he isn\'t a Crossdresser.\n In Detective Conan, Hondou Eisuke gets an "You would have been a cute girl in a manga" from Sonoko, even if that might be mostly because of his behaviour rather than his very feminine appearance.\n Every character who isn\'t a Mentor Mascot in Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!. Goura, brother to The Hero, is an inversion. There\'s also a Bishonen monster but this is a zigzag because his original form looks like Takeo and his monster form looks like a 60s version of a bishonen.\n Death Note:\n Light Yagami.\n Mello, Near, Mikami, Matsuda, Gevanni, Matt, and Namikawa.\n What with the odd mannerisms and dark bags under his eyes, L was intended to be an inversion or aversion of this trope. The legions of fangirls he has don\'t see it that way, though...\n The contrast between Light and L (and their respective fangirls) are even lampshaded a bit in Episode 9, when they\x92re giving a university entrance speech together:\n Girl 1: I sure like the guy on the right [L].\n Girl 2: What\x96?! You\x92re weird. Most people would choose the one on the left [Light].\n Owing to his status as L\'s evil lookalike, Beyond Birthday is regarded as this as well by fangirls. Interesting example in that it\'s not clear exactly what he looked like, or how much he did/did not resemble L, as BB wore makeup to look more like him.\n Ryuk was this in his original design\u25ca, before the creators decided that him looking more interesting than Light could cause fans to ignore Light\'s character.\n Rem in the live-action films. Despite being a female Shinigami in the manga and anime, she was made a male in-voice-only for the live-action movies. The rest of her feminine looking design\u25ca is kept exactly the same.\n Most of the guys in Descendants of Darkness.\n Shoei and Hinata from Desire Climax are both very pretty.\n Allen from D.Gray-Man definitely fits here, seeing as he\'s prettier than a lot of the girls in the series. Lavi, Tyki, and Kanda fit as well.\n Both Ishida Yamato and Ichijouji Ken of Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02 fall into this category. Their actual looks are never commented upon, but one figures that this is at least partially why they are fangirl bait, both in and out of the show. Also lampshaded in an Audio Drama.\n Well, there was that page in the translation of the 02 manga where Daemon calls Ken "the pretty one" (if you\'re thinking that\'s too creepy for words, then you\'re probably still sane).\n In one episode of zero two, Gabumon lampshades this by saying "Yamato isn\'t the only heartthrob here", while Ken was hit on by a very young girl.\n Yamato, notably, had a...considerably older woman try to pick him up when he was eleven.\n To a lesser extent, Takeru, Yamato\'s little brother, seems to gain some level of bish\u014dnen in him when he turned eleven himself. An episode of Digimon Adventure 02 showed a fair number of girls\u2014Hikari among them\u2014practically swooning over him when he was showing off his basketball skills.\n In Digimon Adventure tri., pretty much all of the boys have this aesthetic to them. Yamato/Matt and Takeru/TK (the latter is even shown to have invited a couple of female admirers to the former\'s concert) seem to be the ones who were drawn this way on purpose, but Taichi/Tai, Koushiro/Izzy and even Joe have also gotten quite pretty as well. Mimi lampshades this in regards to Tai and Matt, mentioning that they\'ve grown to be quite attractive (with Sora blushing in response). Heck, even Tai\'s teacher is pretty!\n Dragon Ball Z:\n Future Trunks, Zarbon, Android 17, and arguably Jeice.\n Zarbon in particular is The Fighting Narcissist; his true form is not pretty at all, and he takes a handicap in battle to maintain his good looks.\n Yamcha, especially when he first arrives to fight the Saiyans.\n In the Ocean dub, Burter describes Goku to Jeice this way. "If it weren\'t for you being short and orange, I\'d say he was the better-looking guy."\n Most of the male characters in D.N.Angel.\n Hakuoh of Duel Masters has to be one of the bishiest, with his slender build and long, flowing, silvery-blue hair.\n Durarara!!:\n Kasuka, Shizuo, Izaya, and Shinra. And then Mikado, Kida, Aoba, Seiji, Tanaka Tom, Walker, Shijima, Chikage and...Nasujima-sensei. Unfortunately.\n Minor character Ryo Takigutchi. Seriously, just\u25ca look at him\u25ca!\n Akira Takizawa from Eden of the East is a prime example of this trope, yet much more realistic than some others.\n Elfen Lied: Nousou. Kurama is a borderline example, but is an older man and later grows a Beard of Sorrow.\n Baskerville and Alternate in Et Cetera are quite pretty, helped by Basky\'s long blond hair and Alternate\'s slim figure and monocle.\n Il Palazzo of Excel Saga is very pretty and has long, silver hair.\n Although Eyeshield 21 has a good amount of beefcakes, there\'s also Kisaragi, Kakei, Mizumachi, Akaba, Sakuraba, Harao, and maybe even Taka.\n Zeref from Fairy Tail is revealed to be this after they spend 200 chapters building him up as some great ancient evil. Expecting Someone Taller, or at least older looking, is in full swing here.\n Bedivere from Fate/stay night. He looks and sounds so much like a woman in fact that in a series where King Arthur was revealed to actually be a woman in disguise, many fans at first believed him to simply have undergone the same fate. But, no. He\'s just pretty.\n Lancer of Fate/Zero (aka Diarmuid Ua Duibhne) takes prettiness up to the realm of being a superpower - literally. Unfortunately, supernatural levels of beauty does not mix well with jealous lords and their smitten fiances.\n Mikagami Tokiya from Flame of Recca. He doesn\'t like being mistaken for a girl, though.\n All the male characters introduced so far in Kyoto Animation\'s anime Free!. They are more muscular (which is due to their athletic activities) than the standard.\n Fruits Basket:\n Yuki, and all of the male Sohmas.\n Particularly Momiji, Ritsu, and Ayame. The first wears the girls\' school uniform (albeit not with a skirt) because "it looks cuter on him", while the second presents himself as a woman because of an inferiority complex the size of Antarctica. Ayame, on the other hand, is...just special. Akito also qualifies in the anime, although manga Akito is a different story altogether.\n The lead, Tohru Honda, remarks that the Sohmas are a family of "princes". And towards the end of the manga\'s run, even Momiji graduates to pure Bish\u014dnen status with a growth spurt and switch to the boy\'s uniforms.\n The Bish\u014dnen archetype in sh&#333;jo is parodied quite a few times on cover flaps of Fullmetal Alchemist (more often than not with Roy as the target) and through Mei Chan\'s daydreams about Ed, and then Al, as knights in shiny armours.\n Major Alex Armstrong also appears as a sort of parody, both meeting every bishonen archetype yet defying it too. Not only does he meet the quota of sparkling, hairlessness, beauty, deep voice, and vanity, he\'s also a muscular, oversized bodybuilder, who constantly flexes and lacks an indoor voice.\n At the end of the manga and second anime, Alphonse is revealed to be a gorgeous bishonen.\n He\'s arguably even more of one in the movie of the first anime, since he  shares his brother\'s long hair.\n Ed\'s always been Bish\u014dnen, and even has long hair.\n One of Father\'s transformations turns him into one of these.\n In the first anime, Roy actually sparkles during his "Flame vs. Fullmetal" duel with Ed - a trait usually reserved for Armstrong.\n Full Metal Panic! brings us Kurz, who was even a former model. Then, we\'ve got Leonardo. And, of course, Sousuke, in an Unkempt Beauty sort of way.\n Just about every male character from Fushigi Yuugi. Most of their brothers from other Yuu Watase manga are bishies as well. It\'s Yuu Watase, what do you expect?\n Future Diary: Yuki and Akise.\n Game X Rush: Memori and Yuuki.\n Gankutsuou: Franz, Albert, and especially Andrea.\n GaoGaiGar. Paragon of Hot-Blooded manliness he may be, but Gai Shishio is still too pretty to be male\u25ca.\n Kousaka from Genshiken. The most feminine-looking male club member, he is the only one with a girlfriend in the beginning, let alone a sex life.\n Most of the male characters in Get Backers, but Kazuki takes it to almost painful levels.\n Ghost Hound: the entire male cast for the most part, especially Tarou, who is downright Moe.\n Ghost Hunt: almost all of the male characters. Lin, Naru, Bou-san, even John are bish\u014dnens, pretty boys, handsome, etc, etc...you watch a video of Ghost Hunt on YouTube, scroll through the comments, and you will find a lot of fangirling female users.\n Sougo Okita, Kotarou Katsura, and Kamui of Gintama.\n Every guy from Gravitation, especially Yuki and Shuichi.\n Gundam has its fair share of bishie boys.\n Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, in particular, was full of them. And among the Gundam Wing bishie brigade, Quatre Winner deserves special mention. A slim, platinum-blond Berber. Needless to say, you can find a fairly large amount of fanart of him.\n Protagonist Heero Yuy also deserves a mention, since Word of God admitted that his appearance was inspired by a Japanese actress, Yuki Uchida.\n Mobile Fighter G Gundam has George DeSand from Neo France, operator of Gundam Rose.\n Kamille Bidan, the main protagonist of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.\n Almost all of the male cast in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny.\n Gundam 00, oh ho ho. Apparently, every male under the age of 35 will be absolutely gorgeous in the 24th century, in addition to shrinking their shirts in the dryer to show off their buff figures. Then again, this was pretty well predicted the second they announced that Yun Koga would be designing 00\'s cast.\n We also need to mention Turn A Gundam\'s Loran, who was quite possibly one editorial mandate away from being a full-blown woman.\n Mobile Suit Gundam: Char\'s Counterattack. While he\'s too old to count as a bish\u014dnen, Char Aznable looks far more prettyboy-ish\u25ca than he did in earlier series, this makes him Biseinen.\n Even in the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Char stands out as a pretty boy, notable because the art style of the time rendered almost every other character Gonk. The only character to rival his bishounen-ness is Garma.\n Hakuouki is full of effeminate pretty-boys. The entire series is basically a reverse harem, and is guaranteed to make anyone\'s inner Fangirl Squee! in joy.\n Numerous male characters in \xbd Prince.\n Hana No Kishi: Ibara, Saiki, Houjou, and Midori.\n Itsuki Koizumi in Haruhi Suzumiya. That is, in a Brigade of crazy people, with a cynical Deadpan Snarker who constantly tells him that no one cares about him. He probably just appears to be one, but he sure seems to make most women blush. As Kyon puts it, \'A face I wouldn\'t introduce to my girlfriend\'.\n Hellsing: appearance-wise, Luke is a sophisticated prettyboy. Also, Schrodinger and young Walter. Alucard is the Biseinen version of this trope.\n Tamamo from Hell Teacher Nube gets away with lots of things that Nube is beaten up for just because he\'s a Bish\u014dnen\n Joey from Heroman... well, let\'s just say that just about everyone mistook him for a girl at first. Psy, too.\n Highschool DXD Gives us Yuuto Kiba\u25ca\n Taken even further by Gasper\u25ca Vladi\u25ca Yes... That is a boy. Warning, the first image linked may be considered NSFW\n Hunter \xd7 Hunter: Hisoka, despite also being a Monster Clown. Less unusually, Kurapika and Shaiapouf.\n Hyouka gives us Houtarou, Satoshi, Masashi, Jirou, and Muneyoshi.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I - P\xa0\n Most of the male cast of Ikoku Irokoi Romantan.\n Inukami!: Keita and Hake, as well as most other male characters who isn\'t macho or Gonk.\n A number of male characters from InuYasha, including Sesshoumaru, Naraku, etc.\n Inux Boku SS has a Cast Full of Pretty Boys - Miketsukami Soushi being in the spotlight.\n Katori, Dom, and the nameless terrorist from the second episode (who is mentioned because his prettiness is a plot point) from Irresponsible Captain Tylor.\n JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure features Noriaki Kakyoin, who is only this compared to the rest of the main cast due to being the shortest and the least buff. Nevertheless, he is a VERY popular example on Pixiv and a target of Wimpification. Part 5 plays this more straight with its Cast Full of Pretty Boys, especially Narancia.\n There is a lot of focus on people\'s looks in Jyu-Oh-Sei, despite the action being set mostly on a jungle planet with vicious plants and a murderous climate that\'s used as a prison for criminals. All of the male characters are\u25ca exceptionally\u25ca pretty\u25ca.\n Kaguya Hime: many, if not most of the male cast; in particular, Yui and movie star Brett Miller. Nobuo is a very notable aversion.\n Kamisama Kiss has quite a few. To start off you have Kurama along with Tomoe and Mizuki\n K\xe4mpfer: Natsuru Senou in his male form.\n Kare Kano: Hideaki Asaba and Soichiro Arima.\n Ren from Karin\n Leon Oswald and Yuri Killian in Kaleido Star.\n Karakuridouji Ultimo: most of the doji. Also, Murayama and Rune.\n Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru has the pretty boy protagonist, Minoru.\n Karneval: Most of the guys introduced, including 99% of the main male cast.\n Every single male main character in post-Art Evolution Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, plus 99% of the villains and side cast. This is the most common trope on the character page.\n Akiyoshi of Kawaii Akuma (and its sequels) is often told that he is "cute" or "pretty", and this caused him to develop an inferiority complex. Naruse is also incredibly Bish\u014dnen, to the point of being a Dude Looks Like a Lady.\n A good portion of the cast of Kaze to Ki no Uta, but Gilbert and Rosemarine deserve special mention.\n Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple has Christopher Eclair, a French assassin. It\'s also revealed that Kensei Ma used to be one.\n On the off chance that the audience didn\'t realize Aikuro Mikisugi was the designated Bish\u014dnen of Kill la Kill, Studio Trigger literally made the word beauty part of his name (\u7f8e\u6728\u6749).\n Kimi ni Todoke: Kazehaya, and the female side of the school is very aware of this. Ryu and Kento also count.\n Kimi to Boku: All the main boys in the cast\u25caas well as Hot Teacher Koichi Azuma & his best friend, Akira.\n Reiji from Kodomo no Jikan, especially in the anime. Of course, he\'s a seriously fucked-up bishonen.\n Akito and Naozumi from Kodomo no Omocha.\n Kisaragi Shun in Koko Wa Greenwood (aka This is Greenwood).\n K-On!: There are actually some\u25ca fairly\u25ca good\u25ca looking\u25ca male background characters\u25ca, considering the cute art style.\n Kyo Kara Maoh!\n Wolfram is very pretty (he looks almost exactly like his mother), a definite bish\u014dnen. In fact, Yuuri\'s immediate reaction upon seeing him for the first time is simply to stare in awe and call him exactly that.\n Also, Saralegui.\n Then there\'s every guy in Yuuri\'s "harem", plus Yuuri himself.\n The Legend of Koizumi:\n Pietro, the white knight serving under the pope. He comes complete with accompanying Bishie Sparkles when he first appears.\n Also.. Hitler. He is so Bishounen that his Bishie Sparkles have the ability to hypnotize people into worshipping him\u25ca He can also (in a pinch) go Super Aryan\u25ca\n Litchi Hikari Club has a Cast Full of Pretty Boys - with a strong lack of fanservice.\n A good amount of the male characters in Loveless. Ritsuka is even stated to be very pretty, like a girl.\n Otani, Kohori, Suzuki, Haruka, and, without a doubt, Maitake and Seiko from Lovely Complex.\n  Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha may be directed toward a Seinen demographic, with an Improbably Female Cast, but even it has its share of bishies, such as Yuuno Scrya and Verossa Acous. Yuuno, in particular, was mistaken for a girl by many viewers when he first appeared.\n In Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force, we can add former Cheerful Child Erio to that list. Seriously.\n Aburatsubo from Magic User\'s Club. He\'s tall, has long red hair, and is gorgeous...with the requisite legion of fan-girls expected for any bishonen. The only problem for said fangirls is that he\'s gay and in love with the main character, Takeo.\n Mahou Sensei Negima! gives Negi some magic age-up pills, turning him into one of these. He\'s also a dead ringer for his father, who was also a bishonen. Albireo Imma probably counts too. Teenage Kotaro definitely counts as well.\n Then there\'s teenage Fate...\n And Dynamis Yes, really.\n Maid-Sama!:\n Usui, when he makes the effort, and his half brother, Gerard Walker, who looks like an older and more polished version of him. One could also make a case for Tora Igarashi and Kuuga.\n Soichiro Kanou, too, if he had any confidence in himself, could likely pull this off. Also: a number of fangirls consider The Idiot Trio to be this, on the rare occasions when they\'re drawn normally.\n Mamotte Shugogetten: Izumo and Tasuke. Arguably Takashi as well.\n Kei, Michael (anime-only characters), Yuu, Satoshi, and arguably Ginta in Marmalade Boy.\n Mawaru-Penguindrum: Most of the guys. Main character Shouma is even one of these despite being teased by others that he\'s plain looking.\n Adolf Hitler is drawn this way in the manga version of Mein Kampf. It\'s hard to tell which is the most absurd; Hitler being portrayed as a Bish\u014dnen, or that there exists a Mein Kampf manga.\n Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch provides plenty of bishounen fanservice. The fact that practically every day is a Beach Episode helps.\n Metal Fight Beyblade: Being tanned doesn\'t stop Tsubasa Otori from being a Bishounen.\n Takaya Ohgi and Nobutsuna Naoe in Mirage of Blaze.\n Quite a few of Miyazaki\'s male characters, such as Haku in Spirited Away and Howl in Howl\'s Moving Castle.\n Most of the guys from Monochrome Factor, especially Shirogane, Akira, and Kou.\n Kusuriuri/the Medicine Seller from Mononoke. Even his manner of dress combines gender conventions, and characters in the series make note of how attractive he is.\n Johan from Monster. It\'s especially noticeable when you realize that the anime is one of the few that steers entirely out of the way of Generic Cuteness.\n It\'s even more noticeable when Johan dresses up like his sister and nobody can tell the difference, to the extent of making a male, heterosexual policeman infatuated with him. If all it takes for you to go from a good-looking man to a beautiful woman is a wig and a dress, odds are good that you fit this trope very well.\n He is even explicitly stated to be beautiful by a few people. Even Tenma comments on how he has beautiful eyes.\n Nearly every male character in Monthly Girls\' Nozaki-kun to date, aside from Ken and Nozaki himself. Nozaki is a bit overly muscled by normal standards, to his despair (he can\'t use himself to model for his manga because he\'s not the right body type). For Ken, he\'s fat only when Maeno is in his life; at times he\'s away from Maeno he can fall into this trope as he becomes a lot skinnier.\n Kouichi Hayama, from Moonlight Lady, falls into this description perfectly. Lampshaded with Io Azuma, his wife-to-be\'s cousin; Suzuna was hoping that Io would grow to be this (partially because of an Arranged Marriage to him). Ultimately averted, as Io grew to be a limp-wristed, wide-eyed, Ambiguously Gay "pretty boy".\n Lint, Ricalna and even Zelik when we was younger from Mother Keeper all fit this.\n Michio in MW.\n Nabari no Ou: most of the guys under 30.\n Depending on who you ask, a good number of the male cast in Naruto could qualify as Bishonen. Notable examples include Haku (to Dude Looks Like a Lady levels), Benten (Filler Villain to Dude Looks Like a Lady levels), Sasuke, Itachi, Kakashi, Deidara, Sasori, Neji, Suigetsu, Kimimaro, Orochimaru (when he is not doing something gross), Kabuto, Sai, Gaara, Shikamaru, Kiba, Utakata, and the titular character himself. Naruto definitely counts, considering that he has his mom\'s AND his his dad\'s looks, though this trope is mostly appropriate only after the time skip. Also, the Fourth Hokage, aka Naruto\'s dad. Naruto and his peers\' kids are quite good looking too.\n Neon Genesis Evangelion:\n The character designer of wrote that he designed Shinji to be a delicate/vulnerable-looking bishonen.\n Kaworu is a bishonen of legendary proportions.\n Natsume, Tanuma, Natori, Nishimura - in fact, most of the male cast of Natsume\'s Book of Friends qualify as Bishonen.\n Nezumi and Shion from No6, especially Nezumi, who even dresses up as a girl in episode 5 and is rather convincing, too.\n Noblesse: Rai, Franken, Shinwoo, M-21, and Takeo.\n General Rivan of Nora, and probably Kazuma to certain readers.\n Nurarihyon No Mago has lots of Bishonen. Night Rikuo, Young Nurarihyon, Rihan, Kurotabou, Kuromaru, Tosakamaru, Keikain Mamiru, Shoukera, Yanagida, Kubinashi, and revived Seimei.\n Okane Ga Nai: Yukiya Ayase.\n One Piece:\n Sanji recently has been beating people pretty. His first victim, a hideous Wanze, was rapidly kicked across the face until he became (to his horror) this trope. Later, Sanji, fighting his bounty poster look-alike, does this again, much to his foe\'s joy.\n Played for Laughs in Boa Hancock\'s romantic fantasies about the normal looking main character Luffy - she sees him as typical Bishonen with a full Bishie Sparkle and brown eyes, as well as speaking with a more mature voice than he actually speaks with.\n The series now has its first definitive Bishonen. His name is Cavendish. Not only does he have the Bishie Sparkle, he also has large, glinting eyes, a trait commonly used only for female characters. His glinting eyes pretty much drive the point home, because the eyes of male characters in this series rarely glint, if at all.\n Otomen: the main male characters, especially Asuka, Juta, and Tonomine, whose looks are often commented on. Even Kurokawa can count, if his eyes showed up a lot more.\n Many characters of M\xc4R, on both sides of the good/evil divide. Alvis and Nanashi are this, combined with the headband of eyecovering. Every once-in-a-while, they even comment on it in-universe.\n Basically, all male characters from Ouran High School Host Club, and one of the females. Tamaki (see picture) slightly subverts the usual cool-headed bishie stereotype by being a blithering (but lovable) idiot, and manages to be the male lead and comic relief both at once.\n Harry from Outlaw Star. He even ties his hair with a big, pretty bow. Fred Luo, too.\n The Cast Full of Pretty Boys that is Pandora Hearts. Especially Jack, Vincent, Gilbert, and Break.\n Most other young-ish male characters also count, like Oz, Elliot and Leo. And the latter even more so after an Important Haircut.\n A notable example is Liam; the fact that no male or female pronouns were ever used to refer to him for some time didn\'t help. They fixed this in the anime, however, giving him less feminine features and a decidedly male voice.\n Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Brief is one of these, once his bangs are slicked back.\n George from Paradise Kiss, among many others.\n Peacemaker Kurogane: 99% of the characters are Bish\u014dnen.\n Toji, Kairi, Jigoro, and Ryo from Peach Girl.\n Jeeves and Bertie Wooster get this treatment in the manga series Please, Jeeves; Bertie becomes a Princely Young Man with golden hair while Jeeves is Tall, Dark and Handsome.\n +Anima: Husky. He\'s repeatedly mistaken for a girl.\n Pok\xe9mon\n Cilan, who was being subject to Ouran comparisons before Hilarious Inhindsight kicked in.\n Like in the games, N also fits on this trope.\n Cilan and Chili, Cilan\'s brothers, as well as Cheren also appear, though their roles are much minor.\n Though debatable, James from Team Rocket seems to be a comedic parody of Bishonen as well.\n The four older knights in Pr\xe9tear are examples of this trope, particularly Kei. Goh is borderline, but he makes up for it by baring his midriff in his knight outfit.\n A majority of the male cast of The Prince of Tennis, but especially Seiichi Yukimura, Rikkaidai\'s Knight Templar Magnificent Bastard once ill captain.\n All of the main characters in Princess Princess. Yuujirou, Mikoto, and Tooru being bishies is basically the whole point of the anime. They\'re princesses because they\'re bishies.\n Mytho in Princess Tutu has eyelashes thicker than his girlfriend\'s. Femio is also an over-the-top parody of this type. Ironic in that Vic Mignogna plays an only slightly toned-down version of Femio in Ouran High. Even better there because, no matter how cheesy he is, the girls there actually fall for it.\n The titular Yakumo from Psychic Detective Yakumo fits this trope to a T. Haruka even thinks he\'s a "beautiful person" when she first meets him. Also, a good amount of male college students who pop up.\n Psyren: Oboro, Haruhiko, Junas, Miroku, Shiner, Kabuto, and Shao as an adult.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Q - Z\xa0\n RahXephon:\n Ayato Kamina from is pretty enough that he\'d probably not look out of place in a dress.\n There\'s also Dr. Itsuki (who bears a suspicious resemblance to the above-mentioned Rossiu) and Souichi Yagumo (who bears a suspicious resemblance to his own girlfriend, Kim).\n Loki, Caesar, Cain, and Adel of Reimei No Arcana.\n Miki Kaoru from Revolutionary Girl Utena is mentioned to be one by Utena in the preview of the episode of his first appeareance. Also, practically every guy in the cast.\n Rosario + Vampire has Ginei, Hokuto, Kiria, Fong-Fong, and, after Art Evolution, Tsukune.\n Many of the characters from Rurouni Kenshin, especially the titular character, Mr. Pretty Boy Swordsman himself. Depending on the quality of the animation in an episode of the anime, particularly in the later episodes of the series, and you know, just about all the time in the manga, Kenshin is very pretty despite the fact that he\'s a terrifyingly powerful swordsman who even the manliest of men are afraid of. It doesn\'t help that, towards the end of the manga and in most of the official artwork, his hair always looks extremely long and flows like a bunch of ribbons. Just look at these pictures: [1], [2], [3], [4]. I rest my case. And even more so in the Trust & Betrayal and Reflections OVAS. [5] And then, you know, there\'s Soujiro, Aoshi, Sanosuke, and, heck, even Hiko qualifies, although he\'s pretty manly. Observe: [6].\n The Shitennou in the first season of Sailor Moon, Mamoru Chiba, Ali of the Doom Tree arc, Prince Diamond and Sapphire in Sailor Moon R, the Amazon Trio in Super S, and the Sailor Starlights...sort of. In the manga, even one of the cats qualifies for this with his long haired, midriff exposing human form. The cat in question (Artemis) is even named for a goddess.\n Saint Seiya. From Andromeda Shun\u25ca to Virgo Shaka\u25ca to Pisces Aphrodite\u25ca (yes, that\'s a guy), the place is a bishounen gold mine. See Viewer Gender Confusion for more details.\n And in Saint Seiya Omega, Dragon Shiryu\'s son Ryuhou is often compared to Shun, and for good reason\u25ca.\n Many characters from Samurai Deeper Kyo, including but not limited to Hotaru, Shinrei, Hishigi (technically a Biseinen, as he\'s physically about 30), and Akira.\n Masayoshi of Samurai Flamenco. Fittingly, he works as a model/Teen Idol because he has no other skills besides his good looks.\n Kyuzo in Samurai 7 is tall, slender, and androgynously beautiful; his voice, however, is very male. Shichiroji, too, and Katsushiro is close. Then there is when Gorobei, Heihachi, and Rikichi have to make it to Kanna village... in disguise.\n Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei: Nozomu Itoshiki and his brother Mikoto. Also, four of his only known male students: Jun Kudou, Kuniya Kino, Aoyama, and Haga.\n Almost every male character in Saiyuki. The four main characters are these, of course, but also Kougaiji, Dokugakuji, Hazel, Koumyu, and Ni Jian-Yi/Ukoku.\n Though the artist\'s style is such all the male characters in The Secret Agreement look pretty good, in-story, Iori is singled out as being an incredible beauty for a man.\n Seitokai no Ichizon gives us Ken Sugisaki and especially Nakameguro.\n Numerous guys qualify in Seraph of the End but Yuuji, Ferid, Crowley, Lacus Welt, Yuu, and especially Mika are particularly notable.\n Most of the males in Shugo Chara! are known for their Bishieness.\n Nagihiko Fujisaki takes the Bishie Ribbon in the world of Shugo Chara. When Hinamori first meets Nagihiko, he is actually posing as his female alter ego, Nadeshiko. Why is this boy posing as a girl? The Fujisaki family tradition is for the males to pose as females to learn the ways of Japanese Dancing.\n During the series, Nadeshiko tells Amu that \'she\' and Nagihiko are twins (the rest of the Guardians know about Nagi & Nade, but Amu Hinamori doesn\'t). It\'s not until late in the series that Nagi reveals the truth to Amu.\n Nagihiko: [7]. Nadeshiko: [8].\n Nagihiko even has a female Shugo Chara named Temari, which he can Character Transform into Yamato Maihime: [9].\n The entire male cast of Simoun. The younger men \u2014 who were girls until age 17 \u2014 even still have breasts that haven\'t been reabsorbed yet (especially the hunky chief mechanic Wapourif), and all of them are voiced by female voice actors.\n Skip Beat!: Shoutarou "Shou" Fuwa and Ren Tsuruga.\n Death the Kid, Gopher, and Kishin Asura from Soul Eater.\n Special A: you\'d think a beauty contest was part of the Special A qualifying exam, looking at the male cast. The girls, too, unsurprisingly, since a beauty exam is almost mandatory to be part of most Shoujo casts.\n Eyes Rutherford in Spiral.\n Star Driver\'s Takuto Tsunashi. "Galactic Bishonen" isn\'t a nickname; it\'s his official title as the Chosen One\n Maximilian Jenius from Super Dimension Fortress Macross and Macross7. Also, Linn Kaifun and Conda Bromco from the first series. Justified and repeatedly lampshaded in Macross Frontier with Alto Saotome, who is frequently remarked on for his resemblance to a woman (much to his annoyance). He, and his father, were Kabuki actors who specialised in female performances. Particularly obvious lampshade hanging is his nickname of \'Hime\' or \'princess\' cause he is just so darn pretty.\n A good amount of the male characters in Sukisho, especially Sunao.\n Kantarou Ichinomiya from Tactics is a white/very light brown? haired bishie, who is annoying and greedy, but overall a good person. He is so young looking, nobody really knows his age. It is implied that he is much older than he appears. Many other guys in it also qualify.\n Mochizou Ooji from Tamako Market\n Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\n While the series is generally remembered for its more MANLY characters, after the Time Skip, Rossiu and Simon are undeniably quite bishonen.\n Cytomander is arguably a Bishonen as well, depending on who you talk to.\n What about Viral\u25ca?\n Kamina is a more masculine version than the standard issue bishonen, but he is undeniably pretty.\n Most of the male characters in I\'m Gonna Be an Angel!, but especially Mikael.\n Ichise and Touyama in Texhnolyze.\n Barnaby from Tiger & Bunny (regardless of what he is wearing, be it his battle suit with helmet off or his daily attire with glasses on)\n Ivan Karelin, Nathan\'s opinion is final - his face is on par with Barnaby\'s.\n Tokyo Ghoul has characters like these who\'s looks are commented on in story: Tsukiyama, Kaneki, Ayato, Juzuuya, and Hide. In the sequel there\'s also Furuta (though he\'s a evil and terrifying bishie), Urie, Mutsuki, Hige, and initially Kanae  before it\'s revealed Kanae is actually a she named Karen.\n Many a Tokyo Mew Mew character, covering types from Stalker with a Crush to Jerk with a Heart of Gold to Mysterious Protector (who wins).\n Ren, Rito, and Zastin of To Love-Ru.\n Trigun: Vash, Legato, Midvalley, Wolfwood, Livio, and Knives.\n Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle gives us Fai D. Fluorite and Syaoran,  especially when he\'s aged up a bit, and has quite a few famous bishonen from other CLAMP series pop up as cameos, such as Subaru, Kamui, Yasha, Yukito, and even Watanuki, to name a few.\n Lets not forget the most extreme cases, Kakyou (who, as if it was possible, is even more of a Bishonen here than in X, and Ashura-Ou, who quite a few fans are still convinced is a a woman (though Ashura was technically genderless in RG Veda and actually has no specified gender in this work).\n In Tsukigasa, Azuma is none too happy about being treated like a girl because of his looks, particularly because he was raped due to his resemblance to his mother.\n Keiki in The Twelve Kingdoms is a Bishonen with white hair, who acts as Youko\'s Mysterious Protector.\n Urusei Yatsura. Rei Lum\'s (former fiance) is a tall, stoic, green-haired space bish\u014dnen who drives men to despair and women to squee. Mendou also qualifies, which is basically his most obvious difference from Ataru.\n D from Vampire Hunter D. Even the Guys Want Him.\n With the exception of the vampire hunter Toga Yagari, absolutely all the male cast of Vampire Knight are bish\u014dnen.\n Canute from Vinland Saga, so Bishonen they needed a girl to be a convincing double.\n Dilandau in Vision of Escaflowne (who is later revealed to have been a magically disguised and brainwashed girl). Let\'s just say that most of the male cast is bish\u014dnen, especially Allen and Van. Just look at the opening, for God\'s sakes!\n This is the entire point of The Wallflower.\n Wei\xdf Kreuz gets points for admitting it. Youji calls Omi "bishounen" to his face in one episode, but he ain\'t the only one.\n Both Toboe and Kiba from Wolf\'s Rain look like Bish\u014dnen most of the time, but are actually wolves in disguise. To go further, numerous viewers have mistaken both for girls.\n Yamada Taro Monogatari: Taro, which is a large reason why everyone thinks he\'s Prince Charming. Also, Suguira, who initially views Taro as a rival of beauty.\n The human forms of the Weasel Mascots in Yes! Pretty Cure 5 are this. Coco\u25ca and Nuts\u25ca take it to truly\u25ca extraordinary levels.\u25ca GoGo! also brings us cute little boy Syrup\u25ca.\n Several characters in Yu-Gi-Oh!, including at least Yami Yugi, Seto Kaiba, Malik Ishtar (and how!), Ryou Bakura, Yami Bakura, Pegasus, Ryuji Otogi, and a number of minor supporting characters.\n Yu-Gi-Oh! takes this trope to such ridiculous extents that, chances are, if you\'re a major villain, you\'re probably going to be very feminine in appearance! Not to mention, its successors both have this trope in spades as well.\n The Abridged Series is loaded with jokes about this.\nMarik: Do I look like an \'\'[EFF]\'ing fangirl to you?! Florence: You really don\'t want me to answer that.\n The Obelisk Blue Three Geniuses for starters, as each of them represent a type of popular dere, starting from the Deredere Fubuki , the Kuudere Ryo, and the Yandere Yusuke in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. Most if not all of the male characters can be called bishies, really.\n Plus most of the male cast from Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D\'s\n III\u25ca and V Arclight from Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL.\n A good third of the male cast on YuYu Hakusho.\n 07-Ghost: Teito, Castor, Frau, Labrador, Ayanami, Mikage...Maybe almost all of the male characters of the entire story.\n\nOther examples\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Asian Animation\xa0\n White Phoenix from Qin\'s Moon, doesn\'t help that he gets prettier each season due to Art Evolution. It was even lampshaded during a mini-documentary. Zhang Liang and younger Wei Zhuang qualify as well.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Literature\xa0\n Genji in Cloud of Sparrows, who is described as \'too pretty for a man\' \u2014 as is the character\'s Older Than Print namesake, Hikaru Genji in the Tale of Genji.\n Lord Krishna, the Hindu deity, is depicted as a bishonen in his adulthood. He is painted as a beautiful 20-year-old with clear dark or blue skin, dressed in distinctive yellow silk, and with a peacock feather attached to his diadem. Despite his bishonen appearance, Krishna is The Ace - a superb intellectual, scholar, strategist, warrior, charioteer and Chick Magnet.\n Eclipse Hunter gives us Daren Solaris, who is so pretty that the series\' resident Tsundere bishoujo Action Girl goes into a mad rage when she sees that he normally wears glasses that disguise his prettiness, going as far as to tear his glasses off of his face and grind them into dust. LITERALLY.\n Most of the cast in \xbd Prince falls into this category. The game world requires your character resemble you, but lets people beautify themselves, and a lot of people look very lovely in game. Prince, who is actually a girl in real life and the only person playing an opposite gender in game, ends up being the single most bishie thing in existence. Only a few main characters don\'t take this route, with Wolf having a more mature look in real life and making himself uglier in the game, Gui turning out to be a bishie in real life and not altering his in game appearance. Nan Gong Zui, who makes himself look like a victim of Testosterone Poisoning in game, also turns out to have a very boyish appearance in the real world.\n Rowan in Chronicles Of Magic is known for his handsome, slender features and long blonde hair. Taunted by the soldiers with names like "pretty-boy" and "blondie".\n Valli from the Outlander Leander series is continuously described as beautiful. The main character, Leander, could be considered a bishounen as well. He mentions at one point that his dad wasn\'t sure if he would turn out pretty or handsome.\n Ax\'s human morph in the Animorphs series, due to being made from the DNA of the male and female Animorphs; it also leaves him with a mix of racial features making him difficult to place when he\'s in human morph.\n The boys in Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note\'s starting cast\u25ca are good-looking, but not this trope. But the characters added later mostly falls in this trope, in this cover\u25ca we have Sunahara (lower right) and Mikado (upper left)\u2014and the latter is officially recognized as "beautiful." The males spinoff series Genie Team G Jiken Note\'s starting cast\u25ca mostly falls into this trope.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Manhwa and Manhua\xa0\n A HUGE number of the characters in Ravages Of Time fall under this category. Most of the Water Mirror Eight Geniuses, Sima Yi, and the young members of the Yuan clan are all delicate-looking and gorgeous. Xiao Meng is the extreme, but well, he\'s an eunuch, so that comes with the territory.\n\n\n\n Since the vast majority of the characters in \xbd Prince are made in a video game they\'re all gorgeous (as players often make their characters so). The titular character is noted for being the most good-looking character, since they turned the pretty effect as high as it could possibly go.\n Let Dai: Jaehee is explicitly stated in-series to be very literally a "pretty boy", and the artwork makes that abundantly clear. It\'s one of the reasons that so many girls tend to go after him.\n Woojae from One has the nickname "Prince Charming" due to his good looks.\n Dong-whi from Nineteen, Twenty-One.\n Armand from Priest.\n Kyu Ra from Rure which fits with his "prince charming" image.\n Rai, Frank, Shinwoo, M-21 and Takeo from Noblesse.\n Id from Id is the very definition of this trope. Men and women alike fawn over his beauty. Though more often than not, every person he\'s met has initially thought him a woman.\n\n\n\n\n This is a nearly omnipresent trope in Chinese Wuxia adaptations. If the character is 1. A main or recurring supporting character. 2. Under 25, they\'re probably this.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Music\xa0\n Gackt is a living breathing example of this. Even he admits it. In nine* nine, Gackt is shown some pictures of himself when he was younger, to which he responds, "I was a total bishonen back then...But now I\'m a biseinen." The difference being that bishonen technicality applies to only boys in their teens but biseinen applies to adults.\n Though most members of the kpop group NU\'EST could qualify(excluding Baekho), Ren is the most obvious example, bordering on Dude Looks Like a Lady with his big eyes and long hair.\n SHINee as a group can be described as this just after their debut when they decided to make a mini-drama looking like girls.\n Dong Bang Shin Ki\'s Jaejoong can very well pass as one. Many people say he\'s an anime character come\u25ca to\u25ca life\u25ca.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pinball\xa0\n Many of the Knights of the Round Table in Golden Logres have an unconventionally feminine appearance\u25ca.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Theatre\xa0\n Since Takarazuka in Japan is composed entirely of female actors playing both male and female roles, it\'s no surprise that male roles often look a little Bishonen. Case in point, Wao Youka as The Phantom of the Opera, or Shizuka Asato (Zunko) as Der Tod from Elisabeth.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Video Games\xa0\n Final Fantasy series: any of the main male characters, at least once graphics became advanced enough to portray it; the official character art shows that the older ones actually were this, too, when not depicted with blocky, low-resolution sprites. Specifically:\n Final Fantasy I: Warrior of Light, Final Fantasy II: Firion, Final Fantasy III: Luneth, Final Fantasy IV: Cecil, Final Fantasy V: Bartz, Final Fantasy VII: Cloud, Final Fantasy VIII: Squall, Final Fantasy IX: Zidane, Final Fantasy X: Tidus, Final Fantasy XII: Vaan, and Final Fantasy XV: Noctis. That is every leading male protagonist to date. And the Dissidia: Final Fantasy series includes all of them (except Noctis...and Luneth).\n Final Fantasy VII: Sephiroth. In the original cut of the scene with Sephiroth frozen in crystalized Mako, he was to have feminine curves to allude back to Jenova. Things were scaled back there for the same reason Squall in VIII was made to look more masculine.\n Now, now, let\'s not forget Zack Fair\u25ca.\n Dirge of Cerberus: Vincent Valentine.\n As for Kuja from Final Fantasy IX, he reaches truly Dude Looks Like a Lady proportions. This is even Lampshaded by Queen Brahne, who outright calls him a "girly-man". To be fair, though, he calls her "elephant-lady".\n Dissidia: Final Fantasy: Penelo, in the in-game manual:\nPenelo: Personally? I don\'t believe that boys should be prettier than I am.\n Final Fantasy II: Emperor Palamecia, anyone?\n If you look past the non-human features, Seymour from Final Fantasy X can fit the bill as well.\n Tetsuya Nomura, the designer for many of these characters, is a real-life Bishonen (see his page picture). A 40-year old Bishonen.\n Hope Estheim from the XIII-universe also counts, especially in the sequel.\n And then there\'s Vayne Solidor of Final Fantasy XII, who even in full armour is still a very slender guy with more hair than two out of the three women in the main party.\n A surprisingly large number of The King of Fighters\' main male characters are like this, with Ash Crimson pushing the androgyny to ridiculous levels.\n chaos (no capitalization) from Xenosaga\n \u014ckami has Waka, who FLIES seemingly by virtue of sheer Bishie Sparkle and his improbable headdress.\n Link from The Legend of Zelda, in his teen and adult incarnations. Comedy Central did base Xandir on him, after all. One gay magazine voted him "hottest game character", to the endlessly amusing horror of the teenage males in the fanbase. His incarnation in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess also places him in Hunk territory at the same time by showing off his body and having him partake in various manlier feats than usual.\n Kafei from The Legend of Zelda: Majora\'s Mask is a young version of this.\n Shad from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.\n Demon Lord Ghirahim from The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.\n Kristoph Gavin and his brother, Klavier Gavin, from the Ace Attorney series. Max Galactica and Matt Engarde in Justice For All, as well.\n Most notably, the effeminate Max Galactica, with his flamboyance, camp, and pure fabulousness. (Because you, too, have stolen one of Max Galactica\'s many, many hearts.)\n And let\'s not forget our magenta-clad prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. He\'s so pretty that about five girls (and Oldbag) during the series get crushes on him... not that he notices.\n Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2. He was designed as an androgynously alluring blank slate for the player to project themself onto. There\'s a scene where another character makes a grab for his groin, and is surprised to find he is male. And you have to play as him naked. No, we are not making that up. He was widely reviled for this, among other reasons.\n Naturally, also his thinly-veiled parody in Metal Gear Solid 3, Raikov.\n Leon Kennedy of the Resident Evil series makes the cut, but barely. Even at his prettiest he was still quite solidly built and masculine, and his face becomes a little more chiseled and tough-looking in each new appearance. His haircut, though, remains top-shelf bishonen.\n Because of its Final Fantasy influences, Kingdom Hearts not only features bishonen leads from that series, but its original characters effectively form a Cast Full of Pretty Boys.\n Magna Carta: Tears of Blood kicks the Bishonen up to 11, making its main lead, Calintz, and his apprentice, Azel, almost entirely unrecognizable as male. Chris Arcway manages to dodge the bullet with his open button-up shirt and cocky womanizing attitude, but even Raul, the tall, masculine, goateed swordsman who appears a few times in the game, gets a touch of Bishie thanks to the artstyle (no matter how impossible it seems to be Bishie with a goatee).\n Quite a few male characters in the Disgaea series, including (but not limited to) Mid-boss, Seraph Lamington, Fukubei, Master Big star, Adell, and Tink.\n During the intro narration of Disgaea 4, a portrait of Tyrant Valvatorez drawn in a much more semi-realistic, shoujo-esque style than the simpler, more stylized art of the games is shown. This is the portrait in question\u25ca.\n Mitsumoto and Abyss in Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns.\n Ramirez from Skies of Arcadia seems to rock the "pretty but misunderstood" vibe as hard as he possibly can. Enrique is pretty much his good counterpart. A number of recruitable crew members further the bishounen appeal, particularly Lawrence and Ilchymis.\n The Tales Series is ripe with these:\n Although having more of a fairly (and by that, we mean in the smallest margin, as the game models differ slightly from the official art) masculine face than some other Tales Series Bishonen, Richard from Tales of Graces certainly fits the role, having traditional elements including medium-length blond hair, fancy frilly clothes, and immense popularity throughout the kingdom (in one skit, he mentions his "dilemma" with the sale of Richard-themed items). His seiyuu is even the same as a certain other Bishonen of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, and he even sports Zelos Wilder\'s costume as DLC. Doesn\'t help that his younger self can be seriously mistaken for a girl.\n Zelos from Tales of Symphonia. Yggdrasil, too. Some fans would argue that Kratos is one as well. The game is ripe with bishies. Kratos is a good example of a biseinen, or \'beautiful man\' - what a bishounen becomes when he grows up.\n Several of the guys in Tales of Vesperia: particularly Yuri, who can be mistaken for a woman until he opens his mouth.\n Guy, Luke and Asch from Tales of the Abyss If you count Jade as a verging-on Dude Looks Like a Lady biseinen that\'s the whole main male cast.\n Teddie\'s human form from Persona 4 was clearly designed with this in mind. He makes extensive use of the Bishie Sparkle to manipulate women that he comes across. Not to mention, during the crossdressing scene, he was the only one able to pull off looking like a girl. One male commentator from the audience even exclaims "I\'d hit that."\n Akihiko from Persona 3 certainly qualifies, being quite the Chick Magnet.\n In a less obvious manner, the main character (or Minato) may also qualify, having a very slender figure, subtle facial features, and pretty eyes. He\'s also frequently described as a "pretty boy" or "handsome", to the point where a certain Corrupt Corporate Executive tried to exploit him.\n From Persona 2: Innocent Sin, we have Jun, a character so pretty that many female characters look upon him in envy.\n Naoto Shirogane, also of Persona 4, appears to be one of these...but in a rare subversion, he is actually a she.\n It was an old joke in the fandom that those not familiar with the Mega Man X series would think that Zero was actually a girl, thanks to his Rapunzel Hair and what fans like to call the Booblights. This was even lampshaded by Bass of the original series, when, upon seeing Zero\'s blueprints, scoffs at Zero\'s appearance, thinking that he was "too girly" to be the strongest robot, like Dr. Wily, Zero\'s creator, claimed. And he seems to be quite a Chick Magnet, too; for both fellow Reploids and one human. What was Dr. Wily thinking when he created Zero and came up with that design, anyway? So much for being a threat to civilization...\n Word of God has it that Zero original concept WAS that of being a female robot. The booblights are probably remnants of this concept.\n The majority of Maverick bosses in the series have aggressive looking eyes with thin oval-shaped irises. However, the dragonfly Reploid named Commander Yammark from Mega Man X6 is the only one with big, bright eyes\u25ca with pronounced eyelashes\u25ca. This is why people thought he was female.\n Harvest Moon:\n Julius, Jamie, Tim/Trent, Alex, and Skye.\n Will from Harvest Moon: Sunshine Islands bears more than a passing resemblance to the above-pictured Tamaki.\n It\'s easier to name guys that aren\'t bishonen in more recent games.\n Similarly, many of the young males in the spinoff series Rune Factory are bishonen. The newest protagonist barely looks male, which, what with the Hello, Insert Name Here nature of the game, can lead to some unintentionally hilarious moments:\n"Sophie? What a fine, manly name!"\n Time Crisis\'s newer protagonists.\n Sengoku Basara:\n Uesugi Kenshin takes this far enough that fans seriously doubt he\'s really male. Granted, the games also have Motonari, Keiji, Mitsuhide, and Hanbe, but Kenshin is still the reigning king/queen.\n Keiji is a strange case, as he has a muscular figure but a very pretty face and long, silky hair. And Yukimura also seems to become more feminine looking with each new installment.\n Dynasty Warriors has its fair share, with Jin (Sima Yi, Sima Shi, Sima Zhao, Zhong Hui, Xiahou Ba, Jia Chong, Wen Yang) being a certified Cast Full of Pretty Boys. The other kingdoms don\'t fail to deliver however with Shu (Zhao Yun, Jiang Wei, Guan Suo, Guan Xing, Zhang Bao), Wu (Zhou Yu, Lu Xun, Ling Tong), and especially Wei (Zhang He, Cao Pi, Guo Jia) hosting some impressive examples.\n Samurai Warriors: we have Mitsuhide, Hanbei, Ranmaru, Kiyomasa, Motochika, and Kojiro.\n Don\'t forget Sanada Yukimura, Date Masamune, Mistunari Ishida and Azai Nagamasa.\n Testament of Guilty Gear, who, in addition to his long black hair and androgynous face, has an outfit consisting of a man-bra and a skirt that shows a decent amount of leg. And that\'s not going anywhere near Bridget. There\'s also Ky.\n Fire Emblem:\n Lucius, the amazingly feminine featured pretty boy monk with long blond hair. Of course, he defends the fact that he is male when confronted by Serra.\n A typical Fire Emblem game will have several bishonen, at least a couple of rugged manly men, a few good looking grandpas, and a Gonk or two. Few are as bafflingly pretty as Lucius, though.\n When Super Smash Bros. first showed off Marth, most western players were intially quite confused as to whether Marth was a girl or not. His voice actor cleared this up a bit, though.\n Libra in Fire Emblem Awakening takes this to such ridiculous levels he invokes Stupid Sexy Flanders and Even the Guys Want Him in-universe. Oh, and he has a very feminine voice too.\n Less so than Libra, but the Type 01 build for a male Robin is fairly bishonen, especially if you give him long hair.\n Pit from Kid Icarus: Uprising and his dark counterpart likely qualify also.\n Taichi in CROSS\x86CHANNEL has a rather androgynous but attractive appearance. He, on the other hand, is convinced he is horribly ugly for reasons that are never really revealed.\n Pretty much any guy from the NeoRomance series (Angelique, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de, Kin\'iro no Corda). Eisen of Haruka proved to be pretty enough to disguise himself as a girl on one occasion; even the Emperor is bishounen, though he has the excuse of being Eisen\'s half-brother. In the La Corda d\'Oro anime, one character (Kenichi Shimizu) actually gets called a bishounen by the lead girl when she first meets him.\n Among the attractive male characters in Infinite Space, a few of them fall into bishonen/biseinen category. Lord Roth is arguably the best example, with his waist-length lavender hair and feminine face. Main character Yuri is quite pretty himself.\n Pok\xe9mon Black and White has N, as well as Cilan, Chili, and Cress. Cheren and Hilbert qualify as well.\n Bishonen characters in other games include Falkner, Bugsy, Morty, Will, Wallace, Steven, Roark, Volkner, Riley, Aaron, Lucian, and Marlon. Maxie may count as well, even though he\'s older than the others.\n The male player characters have been trending toward this. Calem, the male player character for X and Y, is probably the most blatant example - especially when compared to Red\'s original game design. Or for previous gens,compare the remake designs to their original ones.\n WarioWare has Young Cricket, who is popular among Japanese female players for being the only bish\u014dnen in the series.\n Dragon Quest has two bishonen: Psaro the Manslayer (Human form) and Angelo.\n Castlevania. Alucard is one of the quintessential examples. Mistaking him for a girl is not likely to be a problem, though, given the loving attention put into his sprite and the fact that his VA has a very, very deep voice. Several other protagonists in later Castlevania titles, such as Juste Belmont and Soma Cruz, are this as well.\n Yuuto is the only male in Eien no Aselia that could really be described as pretty. On the other hand, he\'s also pretty muscular by the end, so despite the face, he isn\'t exactly girly.\n Joshua from The World Ends with You, complete with a girlish giggle to boot.  Being something of a higher plane of existence probably helps.\n Street Fighter:\n Vega, the Spanish ninja. It\'s even part of his character. Vega is a narcissist who believes his face to be extremely beautiful, and cannot stand the ugly. Part of it comes from traumatization as a child when his ugly father killed his beautiful mother. He also wears a mask, not to hide his identity, but to prevent his face from being scarred. Remy in Street Fighter III is even more of one (though he\'s not narcissistic like Vega).\n In the Alpha series, Ken becomes one of these, with long, flowing hair in a ponytail and a younger face (some pieces of art\u25ca for the game even show him with pronounced lips, a rarity for Street Fighter characters). However, the other games show him looking older and more muscular, with Perma Stubble.\n Prince Peasley from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, who makes the whole screen gleam - literally - when he tosses his hair.\n The main character of Shadow of the Colossus.\n Bushido Blade 1 and 2 have Katze.\n Also, Kaun.\n The Suikoden series of games have, quite literally, dozens of bishonen among the ranks of the Stars of Destiny (108 per game!). Notable ones include and are not limited to: every main protagonist, Flik, Luc and Sasarai, and Yuber.\n Sergei from Asura\'s Wrath. Yasha is to an extent too, though not quite as much.\n Many of the characters of Eternal Sonata are well-noted for this, including the game\'s main character Frederic Chopin and the main on-screen avatar character, Allegretto.\n In Bayonetta 2, the Masked Lumen is one under his mask, with sharp, almost elven features and flowing, waist-length platinum-blonde hair. The impressive thing is you can tell he\'s one when just a sliver of his mask gets knocked off, revealing only one of his eyes and the general shape of his features around it.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Visual Novels\xa0\n Higurashi: When They Cry\'s Keiichi is noticeably pretty, and even sparkles a couple of times, as well as Satoshi, who is a more extreme example than Keiichi and is even voiced by a female.\n Umineko: When They Cry has the absolutely adorable Kanon, not to mention Battler. George was made to be this in the anime and the Updated Re-release for the Playstation 3, but in the original sound novels he\'s rather plain in comparison to Kanon and Battler.\n Yukito from Air. As well as a Silver-Haired Tall, Dark and Snarky Ineffectual Loner, he later shares some traits with The Doctor himself!\n Yo-Jin-Bo is a Cast Full of Pretty Boys. Since it\'s a Romance Game, it\'s kind of expected. Bo is considered so pretty he\'s practically female by the other characters; he\'s annoyed when a crossdresser hits on him, but plays this to his advantage and says he should be allowed to guard the Princess during her bath because he "looks androgynous" with his long hair and wouldn\'t disturb her as much as the other guys.\n Heinz Heger in Shikkoku No Sharnoth.\n In Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai! Touma is the most notable contender, but Cap also fits, both of them with fan clubs.\n Fate/stay night features Gilgamesh, the ancient King of Mesopotania, who\xb4s apparently a tall, white, red-eyed blonde who\xb4s commented on by one of the main heroines as "he looked like a model". It seems that A+ Charisma skill is justified. Too bad he\xb4s a giant douche with an ego the size of the Universe until Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, where he drinks a potion of youth and becomes an adorable well-mannered kid who wouldn\xb4t hurt anyone. His child version is of course equally Bishonen.\n Hatoful Boyfriend is the dating sim where almost all of the love interests are pigeons. The exceptions are a quail and a partridge. There is the option to see a pseudohuman alternate appearance at the introduction of each one, and these are all quite bishie even when that doesn\'t really fit the bird or the character (the middle-aged "fat bird" or "fluffy heretic" is just as svelte and pretty as the ones represented as teenaged boys). The only exception is Okosan, who\'s only portrayed as a bird in a school uniform.\n Being a BL game, all of the main characters in DRAMAtical Murder are bishonen. However, most of the protagonists are over 20, so they would technically be considered biseinen.\n Kyousuke from Little Busters!!. Mio outright calls him a bishounen one time. And in the Mask the Saito OVA, at one point he dramatically tears off his mask at sunset and sparkles fly as his hair shakes. (The sparkles being his tears from when he was crying because he was so touched a moment before, but still...)\n Mizuho in Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru. Of course. That being said, he is quite pretty even when not dressing as a girl.\n Pretty much the entire cast of Gakuen Heaven.\n Takuma and Hamaji from H2O: Footprints in the Sand.\n Just about every male in Togainu no Chi, especially Rin and Akira.\n Pretty much the entire male cast of Uta no Prince-sama.\n The five male leads from Hiiro No Kakera.\n In Akatsuki No Goei Kaito claims his greatest skill is that he\'s really hot. He kind of has a point given that he can just sit down and read in public and girls will instantly come flirt with him.\n Many male characters are this in Starry&#9734;Sky.\n Asagao Academy Normal Boots Club has Jared, AKA ProJared, according to his character description he\'s the most attractive person in school. He even sparkles!\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Web Comics\xa0\n Not your typical Mad Scientist, Professor T.X. from M9 Girls! is pretty much the embodiment of this trope.\n In Girl Genius, the artist Phil Foglio made a drawing of a "bishie j\xe4ger" in jest to his wife and co-writer Kaja. At her insistence, it was developed into the purple Long-Haired Pretty Boy we know now as Maxim. Despite being a pretty boy, he\'s still a J\xe4germonster in every sense of the state.\n Wren the protagonist of White Noise, who doubles as a Long-Haired Pretty Boy. This can lead to quite a bit of Viewer Gender Confusion.\n\n\n',

                                   u'text': u'\nDuring one of his eight reigns as NWA World Heavyweight ChampionHarley Race (b. 1943 in Quitman, MO) is a retired American Professional Wrestler and current promoter and trainer best known for his 8 reigns as NWA World Heavyweight Champion during the 1970s and 1980s. He started in Missouri as a teenager before moving to Memphis and wrestling under the name Jack Long and teaming with his "brother" John Long. Over time, he competed for, obviously, many National Wrestling Alliance territories, for the American Wrestling Association, for Stampede Wrestling, and for All Japan Pro Wrestling, before he started winding down his career in WWE in the late 1980s. He retired from active competition in 1991 and became a manager in WCW, most famously for Lex Luger, and, especially, Big Van Vader. He is also the promoter of World League Wrestling in Missouri. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996 and into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2004. He is also on the list of wrestlers who had slammed Andr\xe9 the Giant prior to Hulk Hogan doing it at WrestleMania III.As usual, you can find the basics at The Other Wiki. "Handsome Tropes": Afro Asskicker: Just look at the photo. Arch-Enemy: Dusty Rhodes, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Dick The Bruiser and The Crusher, Junkyard Dog, "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan; (as a manager): Sting, Cactus Jack, Ron Simmons As Himself: As the ring announcer in the 2007 film Mil Mascaras Vs. the Aztec Mummy. Awesome McCool Name: It\'s his real name, too. Badass: Probably one of the top five legitly toughest guys in the history of the business. One of only two people Andr\xe9 the Giant was afraid of, the other being Meng. Bash Brothers: Larry "The Ax" Hennig, Roger Kirby, Bob Roop Blonde Guys Are Evil: His stint as "The King" Harley Race in WWF, and his time as Vader\'s manager in WCW. Cool Teacher: Some of the wrestlers who have trained under him are Richie Steamboat, Curtis Axel and Ted DiBiase Jr. Dented Iron: A case he thinks could have been avoided. After purchasing the deluxe ring package from High Spots for World League Wrestling, he mentioned he had been researching heavily for the best ring his students could have and that if he had a ring like it when he was active he would have still been wrestling up till that point. Determinator: Early in his career, he was in a car accident that killed his wife, and resulted in the near amputation of his leg. After his leg was saved, he was told that he might never walk again. The rest of the story tells itself. Detractor Nickname: In-universe example; The Crusher would call Harley Race and Larry "The Ax" Hennig "The Dolly Sisters", due to their then-fairly pretty looks, especially by 1960\'s standards. Dirty Coward: In 1983, he tried to retire Ric Flair by putting a bounty on him. The Dreaded: He can get guys like Bruiser Brody and Stan Hansen, who were infamously known to use a stiff style of wrestling to ease up and sell his offense by threatening to shoot on them. Drives Like Crazy: Like sixty five MPH in a thirty five swerving around police crazy. It\'s also the basis for one of Manny Fernandez\'s stories on how the two escaped Puerto Rico, though it most likely did not actually happen. Early Installment Weirdness: In the 1960\'s Race was working a pretty boy blond heel gimmick, which was far removed from the gritty (and not pretty at all) tough guy he was when he began his main event run in the NWA. Expy: Some have compared the pairing of CM Punk and Paul Heyman to that of Race and Bobby Heenan. Finishing Move: Fisherman\'s Suplex Diving Headbutt - He innovated this, though he later said that he wished he hadn\'t due to the physical toll it took on other wrestlers who adopted it. Piledriver Heel: His primary role. From Nobody to Nightmare: His beginnings were humble even by pro wrestling standards - he started out in the business as the guy who had to drive around Happy Humphrey, a comedy wrestler who\'s main gimmick was that he weighed close to 800 pounds. I Hit You, You Hit the Ground: "If I hit him with my left [hand] and he doesn\'t go down, I will walk around him to see what\'s holding him up." I Was Quite The Looker: His days as "Handsome" Harley Race\u25ca, alongside the then-equally good looking Larry Hennig. Ironically, neither man would hit the big time until after losing their youthful looks. Lightning Bruiser: Sort of, as his athleticism often showed by dramatic ways in which he took offense rather than dealt it out. That said, he was pretty good at landing on his feet. My God, What Have I Done?: Has gone on record to say that he wished he had never invented the diving headbutt, as it has lead to spinal and brain injuries for those who have used it (Dynamite Kid, Chris Benoit, etc.). Power Stable: The Heenan Family in WWE Real Song Theme Tune: (as "The King" in WWE): Modest Mussorgsky\'s "The Bogatyr Gates (in the Capital in Kiev)" (from his famous piano suite Pictures At An Exhibition. It\'s the same music Haku used during his run as the "King of the WWF" and that Jerry "The King" Lawler has used his whole time in WWE. Red Baron: "Handsome," "The King" Retired Badass: Needed a cane just to stand by 2014 in Pro Wrestling Noah, but there was a reason they had him announce his seal of approval prior to putting on their GHC Championship matches. Okay, a reason might be that his own promotion WLW and NOAH are both part of the Global Pro Wrestling Alliance but that\'s not the reason they had him do it in person. Screw This, I\'m Outta Here!: He and Vader knew better than to stick around when an enraged Madusa started kicking Paul E. Dangerously\'s ass after he fired her from the Dangerous Alliance and went off on a sexist rant at WCW Halloween Havoc 92.note\xa0See The Dog Bites Back under Politically Incorrect Villain on Heyman\'s page. Stun Guns Used one to keep Cactus Jack down for a 10-count in his Texas Death Match against Vader at WCW Halloween Havoc 93. During his stint as Vader\'s manager, there is a story about Race using a stun gun on a naked Vader to get him to hurry his ass out of the shower so they could hit the road. Even for a man Vaders size, getting tazered while naked and wet must have hurt quite a bit. Wrestling Family: His son, Leland, wrestles in various Missouri-based independent promotions, including his father\'s. ',

A former Miss Hawaiian Tropic winner, she previously worked for WWE from 2006-2007 as a member of the Extreme Expos\xe9 dance troupe with Kelly Kelly and Layla. She is a former two-time TNA Knockouts Champion and one time Knockouts Tag Team Champion with Tara.She also appeared on the 25th season of The Amazing Race in 2014 along with her then boyfriend, Robbie E, a fellow TNA wrestler.For more info, visit That Other Wiki. Asstastic Tropes Aborted Arc: She was released shortly after she and Layla turned heel on Kelly Kelly. Alternate Company Equivalent: It could be just a coincidence that she started using the stinkface in her matches after Kelly Kelly was doing it in WWE. And on the flipside, Layla started doing it as well when she was a face. Amazonian Beauty: Looks like a regular girl until she\u25ca flexes. She was actually persuaded by her agent to stop modelling for being too ripped. Arch-Enemy: Tara in TNA, after being betrayed by her. Ass Kicks You: Her signature move, "Asstastic" a running hip attack to a seated opponent, followed by a stinkface. Breakup Breakout: She was The Jannetty initially as she was released by WWE in 2007. Kelly Kelly and Layla would go on to become Divas\' Champions, and Layla would be the last ever Women\'s Champion until it was revived in 2016. However she eventually subverted this by becoming Knockouts Champion, arguably the best wrestler of the three, and the only one still activenote\xa0her current pregnancy notwithstanding since Kelly and Layla have now retired. Bare Your Midriff: More often than not. Behind the Black: After beating Jade, despite Marti Belle\'s interference on an addition of Impact, she and Rebel were somewhere around the locker room celebrating. The second Brooke happened to be off camera the Dollhouse stormed in and gave Rebel an extended beating with Brooke nowhere in sight. It\'s possible she just ran away, but unlikely since it was just established Brooke could handle them even with a numbers advantage. Biker Babe: After taking the role of Bully Ray\'s valet. Blonde, Brunette, Redhead: The redhead (well light brown) in Extreme Expose. Boobs-and-Butt Pose: Pretty much her signature pose. Buxom Is Better Canon Name: All three of them, at various points in her TNA career: Started without "Brooke" after being hired as Eric Bischoff\'s secretary. Dropped "Miss" and regained "Brooke" when she became a regular wrestler. Went back to "Miss" when Brooke Hogan was hired. Returned "Brooke" when Brooke Hogan left and dropped "Tessmacher" after performing a heel turn and becoming the valet of Bully Ray. Expy: of Lex Luthor\'s assistant in Superman: The Movie, name and all. Face\x96Heel Turn: Became Bully Ray\'s valet after he was revealed to be the president of Aces & Eights. Finishing Move: The Tess-Shocker, a Belly-to-Back facebuster. Sometimes an elbow drop from the top rope too. Girl Posse: Extreme Expose. Girly Bruiser: Half her offence is based around her ass, but she still kicks plenty of it. Good Is Not Nice: She\'s kind of bitchy, even when playing a face. Hair Flip: As part of her entrance. Heel\x96Face Return: Returned from filming The Amazing Race as a face, after Robbie E insulted her. Hotter and Sexier: After her Face\x96Heel Turn. Informed Ability: It was fairly obvious she and Kelly Kelly had no dancing training. Male Gaze: She considers her butt to be her best asset no pun intended and is pretty much the focus of every photoshoot she does. Ms. Fanservice: Have we mentioned her fantastic ass yet? Put on a Bus: Announced her departure from TNA in November 2015. One Steve Limit: Went back to being called Miss Tessmacher after the controversial hiring of Brooke Hogan. Subverted in that other wrestlers and even Brooke Hogan herself still called her Brooke. Now that Brooke Hogan is gone, she reclaimed her first name. Sexy Secretary: Was introduced as the personal assistant of Eric Bischoff. Shaking Her Hair Loose: Would come out to the ring with her hair in a bun, and would shake it out as she entered. Along with removing her glasses too. Signature Move, The aforementioned Asstastic as well as a diving elbow drop. Spiritual Successor: Her Miss Tessmacher character was an obvious one to Stacy Keibler\'s Ms Hancock. Tag Team: TNT with Tara The Three Faces of Eve: In Extreme Expose - Kelly was the child, Layla the wife and Brooke the seductress. Took a Level in Badass: Initially appeared in TNA as a secretary - and had been only a dancer in WWE. She eventually transitioned to wrestler and won a couple of titles. Vocal Dissonance: She has a pretty low-pitched voice for a model. She is from Texas, though. You Can Leave Your Hat On: Her entrance evoked this - untying her hair, removing her glasses and taking off a coat. ',

                                   u'text': u"\nTyler Kluttz (born May 4, 1984) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his time in WWE under the ring name Brad Maddox, and was for a time the General Manager of Raw. Tropes associated with Brad Maddox Attention Whore: And he'll actually be the first to say that his actions are motivated by it. Be Careful What You Wish For: Wanted some attention, and wanted a match with Ryback. It was only after getting into the ring with Ryback that Maddox realized how deep he'd stepped in it. Extended to his entire gimmick and perhaps mixed with a bit of Screwed By The Promotion: Several occasions he's asked for a match to get onto the WWE roster. His opponents have been (not a comprehensive list): Ryback, The Great Khali, Brodus Clay, Randy Orton, Sheamus. Butt Monkey: Dear lord that man can't catch a break. Just see above on Be Careful What You Wish For. This extends to his role as General Manager. He's barely around, and this is because The Authority are running the show, and when he is around, The Shield are attacking him for his association with them. Demoted to Extra Felt that taking a referee job was this when he was called up to Raw, after it had turned to three hours and AJ felt they needed more refs. Him as Raw General Manager. With the storyline of The Authority running the show, he barely appeared. He was then relieved of GM status Expy: In-ring competitor with an extremely smug and smarmy personality becomes the vest-wearing, coffee-drinking assistant to a heel GM? Are we talking about Brad Maddox or David Otunga? From Nobody to Nightmare: Not in a combat sense, but we're talking about a guy that went from an NXT Developmental Talent to a rookie ref to the General Manager of WWE's flagship show in a little over a year. Groin Attack: Delivered one to Ryback. Ryback wasn't happy once he got up to a vertical base. I Did What I Had to Do: Feels that him screwing Ryback out of the WWE Championship justifies his actions as now everyone is talking about him. Insistent Terminology: Two instances. Brad insists on dubbing himself the 'assistant managing consultant' of RAW (Does this remind you of anything??). Vickie insists on calling Brad 'the assistant to the managing consultant' of RAW. The difference between the two titles is pretty simple: The former means he has some power over the Superstars and can book matches, the latter just means he's just a coffee boy. Kicked Upstairs: Now an assistant to the managing consultant to Vickie Guerrero. Up to Eleven: With Vickie Guerrero just geting fired as the RAW Managing Supervisor... Guess who got named Permanent General Manager of Monday Night Raw? Meaningful Name: Very likely unintentional but consider his real surname and the small man with the big ego he is currently portraying. Miles Gloriosus/Small Name, Big Ego: And it wasn't because Heyman payed him to do his and Punk's dirty work, and him thinking because of it, he could act all smug. Even Michael Cole thinks he's annoyingly smug. Number Two: To Vickie... even though she says otherwise. Put on a Bus: Once he was relieved of his GM status he disappeared off television all together. The Bus Came Back: Came back in a November 2015 taping of Main Event, with his hair bleached, teaming with Adam Rose...only to lose to the Usos...oh, and turns out that was his last match for the company as four days later he was released, for swearing at a dark match. Running Gag: His quest for a WWE contract. Which never ended well for him. Smug Snake: OH MY GOD. Squash Match: His first match, by his own choice, was against Ryback, who he had screw out of the WWE Championship. It went as well as expected And pretty much every match he's been in since coming up to the Main Roster. Too Dumb to Live: Nut-shotting Ryback... and then challenging him to a match a couple of weeks after he nearly broke you in half in a fit of rage. Yeah. That about says it all. Unfortunate Name: His real last name. You Have Outlived Your Usefulness: Turns out to everyone's surprise, he was in league with Paul Heyman, CM Punk, and The Shield after all... up until Paul Heyman decided this and released him from his employ - complete with a Shield beatdown.

                                   u'text': u'\nTerri Lynne Boatright Runnels (born October 5, 1966) is a retired professional wrestling manager, and occasional professional wrestler. Runnels began her professional wrestling career in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where she did makeup for the wrestlers until booker Ole Anderson eventually asked her to become part of the roster as a manager. Runnels debuted in 1990 as Alexandra York, a laptop-carrying accountant who was the manager of The York Foundation, a group of wrestlers with finance-themed gimmicks.She later joined the WWF, debuting at the Royal Rumble 1996 as Marlena, a character modeled after Marlene Dietrich; the coolly, cigar-smoking, seductive, nonchalant and mysterious manager of her then real-life husband Goldust. The Marlena character would disappear in the aftermath of Goldust\'s feud with Brian Pillman, which was cut short after Pillman\'s death in the middle of the storyline. Runnels later re-emerged in 1998 under her real name, where she would form the Pretty Mean Sisters alliance, had both The Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian vying for her services in the Terri Invitational Tournament, had a feud with The Kat, managed The Radicalz stable, and worked as a host and interviewer. During her time with the WWF/E, she briefly held the Hardcore Championship, her only championship during her career.As usual, you can find the basics at her page over at The Other Wiki.Tropes related to Terri Runnels: Aborted Arc: The storyline with her as Brian Pillman\'s valet in September 1997 was supposed to have led to her going heel on Goldust, but Pillman\'s death cancelled those plans. Instead, she was Put on a Bus of her own accord so she could focus on taking care of her and Dustin\'s daughter, Dakota. Ambiguously Gay: Very slightly alluded to when she first debuted as Goldust\'s valet - mostly through her smoking cigars. WWF booking wanted to put her in an ambiguously-lesbian angle with Sable, but Sable refused to do the angle and so the ambiguously gay aspect of Marlena\'s character was quietly dropped. Arch-Enemy: Chyna at first, because she debuted during the Goldust-HHH feud in February 1997, later the Kat. Ask a Stupid Question...: And the Undertaker will ask you, "What\'s your point?," as he did on the July 1, 2002 Raw, when Terri asked him if he was concerned going into his ladder match with Jeff Hardy that night since he\'d never been in one before. Blondes Are Evil: When she was with Goldust and Pretty Mean Sisters. Breather Episode: Her "Thong Stinkface Match" vs. the Kat at SummerSlam 2000 was this. The match came right after the big TLC match between the Hardys, Edge/Christian and The Dudley Boys, and was a chance for the announcers and the audience to catch their collective breath. After a match filled with all kinds of stunning, groundbreaking, exciting and innovative action, it was necessary to slow down the pace by putting on a match that, well, wasn\'t. The Bus Came Back: In September 1998 for the Val Venis feud. Buxom Is Better: Especially considering how short she is. Dark-Skinned Blond: Due to tanning. Does Not Like Men: As part of the Pretty Mean Sisters. Faux Action Girl: While she did wrestle occasionally, she mostly served as either a manager or eye candy. Girly Girl: Described herself this way in an installment of her "Raw Sex" advice column in Raw Magazine. Hand or Object Underwear: To introduce her "Terri Invitational Tournament" (see Skirts and Ladders below), she did a promo where she was sitting on a couch naked with money covering her. Heel\x96Face Revolving Door: Late 1998 into early 2000. Huge Guy, Tiny Girl: She\'s 5\' even, Goldust is 6\'6". I Have Boobs, You Must Obey!: Played straight, later averted: Straight: On the premiere episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, January 4, 1997, Goldust (w/Marlena) faced The Sultan (Rikishi) (w/Mr. Bob Backlund). At one point, the Sultan had Goldust trapped in the camel clutch. Marlena got up on the apron and, with her back to the camera, lowered the top of her dress (though she was wearing a paste-on bra), causing Backlund to freak out and attempt to cover the Sultan\'s eyes. Goldust ultimately won by countout, and Marlena was jokingly announced as the "winner." Averted: Crossed with Real Life Writes the Plot: Was the manager for the Radicals (Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn) in early 2001. Saturn had faced Mike Bell on the May 12 (taped May 7), 2001 episode of Jakked in a match where Saturn got dropped on his head and retaliated by stiffing the heck out of Bell, leading to him being Put on a Bus for a few weeks. On the May 21 episode of Raw, Terri entered the APA\'s office and attempted to distract them by pouring their beer on her white shirt. Later, the APA faced Saturn and Malenko (w/Terri, who had changed to a robe) in a match where, as Saturn\'s punishment for stiffing Bell, the APA beat the heck out of him, with Bradshaw No-Selling Terri flashing him. This led to Saturn\'s gimmick of saying goofy things that always ended with him saying "You\'re welcome!" and carrying around a mop he called "Moppy." Improbable Weapon User: As Alexandra York in The York Foundation, her laptop computer. Lingerie Scene: The Divas Undressed photoshoot. Ms. Fanservice: Occasionally wrestled, but that really wasn\'t her job. After Val Venis defeated Marc Mero by DQ on the September 13 (taped September 1), 1998 WWF Sunday Night Heat, Jackie attacked her, prompting Jim Ross to say, "She\'s a showhorse, not a workhorse." Nipple and Dimed: Ivory pulled her shirt off on the April 5, 1999 Raw, and she wasn\'t wearing a bra, but she was face down on the mat before anything could be seen. Then the Undertaker made his way out and completely changed the subject. Older Than They Look: Take a look at her pictures on herTwitter account or her website. She still looks gorgeous at nearly 50 years old. Power Stable: (in WCW): The York Foundation. (in WWF): The Radicalz. Red Baron: "The Horny Little She-Devil" Sexy Soaked Shirt: Along with the example above, some during photoshoots. She was supposed to have a Wet T-shirt contest against Trish on the January 7, 2002 Raw, with Lawler "officiating" of course, but Jazz ran in and beat up Trish instead. Shout-Out: The name "Marlena" was a tribute to Marlene Dietrich as part of her and Goldust\'s salute to the androgynous stars of classic Hollywood. Skirts and Ladders: The finals of her "Terri Invitational Tournament", where the winning team got $100,000 and Terri\'s managerial services, between the Hardys and Edge/Christian was a ladder match at No Mercy 1999. To promote it, she did a promo where she was climbing a ladder while wearing a skirt, complete with Lawler looking up, though, uncharacteristically, nothing was actually shown. Smoking Is Glamorous: As Marlena. Tar and Feathers: On September 2, 2002, she faced Stacy Keibler on Raw in the first-ever Lingerie Pillow Fight. Although Terri won, Stacy got revenge on her by KO-ing her with a giant alarm clock and then coating her in some sort of dark goo and pillow feathers. Trash Talk: On the January 6 (taped January 3), 2002 Sunday Night Heat, ran down Trish Stratus, saying how, when Trish arrived in WWE, everyone was saying that she was doing a "Terri Runnels she-devil gimmick," adding that she has better legs than Trish does and, "I even think I spent more money on my boob job than Trish." Terri finished by throwing to the premiere of Rob Zombie\'s "Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)" video,note\xa0Which included clips of Edge, as this was his new theme song at the time saying that she\'s never gonna stop being better than Trish. Trope Namers: In-Universe: While a member of PMS, introduced the word "Diva" into WWE\'s lexicon, though she rarely gets the credit for it. (She wasn\'t even nominated for "Diva of the Decade" at the Raw X special in January 2003). Underboobs: Had a tendency for wearing half-shirts. Walking Swimsuit Scene: MANY Divas photoshoots. Wrestling Family: Ex-wife to Dustin "Goldust" Runnels. You Go, Girl!: Actually defeated Stevie Richards for the WWE Hardcore Championship on the May 27, 2002 Raw... though Richards rolled her up right after to regain it. ',

                                   u'text': u'\nStep Inside the Bunker...Short-lived Professional Wrestling promotion aired on MTV in 2007.Presented as an "underground" fight-club, taking place in the WSX Bunker, the focus tended to be on high-flying in-ring action, boosted by a ton of pyrotechnics and MTV production style. While criticized for its obvious use of planted audience members, the thirty-minute episode length, some questionable musical guests, and announcers that oozed Totally Radical faux-edginess, generally the matches themselves were of high-quality, the wrestlers had some interesting (and often hilarious) gimmicks, and the explosions were pretty cool. During its run, additional matches, promos and commentary was shown online at the show\'s website.All in all, it had the marks of a promotion that had just started to find its voice when it was Screwed by the Network: MTV took offense at a spot where wrestler Ricky Banderas set opponent Vampiro on fire, and pulled the show from the schedule. The rest of the episodes were quickly burned off in a single night, with the final episode unseen until the DVD release.As usual, you can find the basics at The Other Wiki. "Trope Society X": Acrofatic: Vic Grimes. Added Alliterative Appeal: Matt Cross and Teddy Hart, "The Filth & the Fury". Artistic License: The Cartel, a stable of Mexican gangsters, lays dead fish on their beaten opponents. The commentators note that they borrowed this gimmick from The Mafia, who doesn\'t otherwise have a presence on this show. Balls of Steel: The Human Tornado, his balls might be his least vulnerable part The Beautiful Elite: MTV would make sure that attractive and cool looking young people were seen in the front rows of the crowd. Some of them were probably plants. Breakup Breakout Out of the entire roster of Wrestling Society X, the most successful alumni would be Tyler Black, who would eventually sign with the WWE and become Seth Rollins, a member of The Shield, one of the most popular wrestling stables of the modern era. After the Shield broke up, he would go on to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Ricky Banderas has achieved similar levels of success, but he was already becoming a big name in pro wrestling through IWA Puerto Rico before Wrestling Society X was conceived and had cemented his legacy in AAA before it had finished. A lesser case was Horiguchi, who would do well in Dragon Gate with his Hage gimmick. Chickification: Lizzy Valentine was a trained wrestler herself but was relegated to being Matt Sydal\'s girlfriend and manager. Could technically be justified as there were no other women on the show for her to wrestle, though it wouldn\'t have exactly been hard to find any more on the indies. Deep South: The Trailer Park Boyz Disco Dan: That 70s Team Emo Teen: DIFH [Doing It For Her] (Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black) Gorgeous George: Matt Sydal, complete with a "valet" to make it ambiguous Human Popsicle: Matt Classic (better known as Colt Cabana), a wrestler recently revived from the 50s who uses hilariously outdated wrestling maneuvers and survives on a diet of "raw eggs, mayonnaise sandwiches and cigarettes". Impressive Pyrotechnics: Every episode opens with flame jets in the ring posts and a lot of explosions added in post. A lot of episodes ended with Stuff Blowing Up in spectacular fashion. Let X Be the Unknown: The mysterious X bunker this all took place in Odd Couple: DIFH were portrayed this way, with Jimmy Jacobs being "The Sensitive One" (unsurprisingly) while Tyler Black was "The Intense One". Illustrated no better than in a backstage segment after losing a tag match to That 70\'s Team, where Jacobs strums a guitar insisting that Black talk about his feelings, while Black has a massive rage fit about how they lost to a couple of "hippies". Parts Unknown: Jimmy Jacobs, from "The Dark Side of a Broken Heart" Pretty Fly for a White Guy: Dew rag wearing Jack Evans Real Men Wear Pink: Teddy Hart wears pink ring gear since he\'s a Hart and that\'s his family\'s colour. Shown Their Work: Compared to other musical guest commentators, rapper Pitbull knows his stuff about wrestling. The Smurfette Principle: Lizzy Valentine, the sole female member of the roster. Well, Nic Grimes was female too but the only thing ever said about Nic was that Nic was related to Vic Grimes. The whole significance of "Nic" would be completely lost on those not already familiar with her previous "Nikki" gimmick. Spot Monkey: Nearly the entire roster. A lot of them would go on to improve and become major names in the indies. Not all of them really needed to improve either, since the show was only thirty minutes long, there wasn\'t much time to tell stories anyway, so creating a distinctive product was the priority settled on. Stuff Blowing Up: For example, the WSX Championship has twice been won via pinfall in an exploding coffin. Totally Radical: The entire production. The commentators have often been accused of this.

It\'s an all-women\'s wrestling show and it is purely So Bad, It\'s Good. It is a show of over the top gimmicks (who each get introduced with a catchy little rap like the one above), pink ring ropes, cheesy segments and a commentator that let looses a Hurricane of Puns in every match (while sounding eerily like Stan Lee). And yet, it features some of the top women wrestlers in North America including many SHIMMER stars. Its flagship show is Take Down, which Viacom wished to pickup for a second season in 2011.The entire show can be summed up in this video.Provides examples of: Added Alliterative Appeal: Charlotte\'s finisher, the "Confederate Crush". Advertised Extra: Malibu McKenzie, Shauna-Na, Super Nova and Jimmy\'s Angels who were important enough to get a rap solo but barely appeared on the show. All American Face: Glory.  She wins the Wrestlicious title too. Alliterative Name: Kandi Kisses, Kickstart Katie, Malibu McKenzie, Cousin Cassie, Tyler Texas... Amazon Brigade: Jimmy\'s Angels. Amazonian Beauty: Alexandra The Great. Not the biggest ever but well cut. An Ice Person: Autumn Frost who "is so cold her outfit turned blue". As Herself: Lacey Von Erich, the only girl on the show who doesn\'t have a gimmick. Also Daizee Haze is pretty much playing the same character she normally plays on the indies as Marley. Badass Adorable: Most of the roster, even the ones you\'d least expect as further elaborated on the \'she cleans up nicely\' entry further down. Badass Boast: See Gratuitous Rap below. Bare Your Midriff: Try looking for those who don\'t Barely There Swim Wear: Malibu McKenzie and her bikinis. Beauty Is Never Tarnished: The Wrestlicious girls will never get bruised or bloodied, or even have their hair badly messed up despite beating the crap out of each other. Belly Dancer: Aziza\'s gimmick. Big Applesauce: Toni The Top. And Brooke Lynn (despite being played by a New Jersey girl). Biker Babe: Kickstart Katie. Also a female Badass Biker. Boisterous Bruiser: Brooke Lynn. The Cameo Several notable wrestling names repeatedly appeared in the "Are You Smarter Than A Male Wrestler?" segments. Also, Austin Aries was a referee on one episode. Canon Name: Marley was only given a first name but according to Daizee Haze, the character\'s last name is Sebastian. Catch Phrase: Boot Camp Bailey\'s "Atten-tion!" Catholic School Girls Rule: The Naughty Girls, played by SHIMMER\'s Portia Perez and Nicole Mathews. The Cheerleader: Averted with Amber Lively who is sweet and perky. Comically Missing the Point: Bandita is proud to say that her restaurant doesn\'t have a roach problem - the rats ate them all. Companion Cube: Sierra Sheraton has a stuffed chihuahua she calls "Gucci". Cool Mask: Super Nova, why are we not surprised. Country Mouse: Sweet little Cousin Cassie from down on the farm. Cute Bruiser: Felony of a fairly average size but fights pretty rough, unsurprisingly. Delinquent Hair: Juvi Hall\'s hair has pink streaks in it. An obvious sign she\'s no good. Distaff Counterpart: Glory is of course one to Hulk Hogan, Trope Codifier of the All American Face. Fans have suspected that Coco Montegro is one to Kofi Kingston. Dreadful Musician: Kandi Kisses who must lip synch during live performances. Drill Sergeant Nasty: Boot Camp Bailey, who mainly puts her maggots in hopeless match ups as "training". Dumb Blonde: The "Are You Smarter Than A Male Wrestler" segment which had the girls going up against a dumb blond male. Everything\'s Better with Princesses: Maui is apparently an Island Princess and Autumn Frost is the Ice Princess because of course their characters wouldn\'t be complete without the title. Face\x96Heel Turn: Kandi Kisses on the first episode when it was revealed she was lipsynching during her performance. Fanservice: The "Wrestlicious Spotlight" segment which was 30 seconds of one of the girls on the beach in a bikini. Faux Action Girl A handful of the girls who were trained for the show but didn\'t get into the ring that much. Maui is probably the biggest example. Her opening rap says "I pack punch like molten lava" and she is defeated by Toni the Top in under a minute. Boot Camp Bailey qualifies as well. She is a Drill Sergeant Nasty but played by a model so she\'s never shown actually training the girls herself. Aziza appears ready to compete in a match but it gets changed and she\'s never seen again. Genki Girl: Amber Lively, Tyler Texas, Cousin Cassie, Shauna-Na and Lil\' Slamm. Genre Blind: Paige Webb is Genre Blind enough to keep opening the clearly pervy e-mails she gets from her fans. Girl Posse: Kandi Kisses has her backup dancers The Gumdrops. Shauna-Na also has a gang of other 50s girls The Be-Bops. Girlish Pigtails: Cousin Cassie, Tyler Texas. Girls Behind Bars: A theme with Felony\'s skits. Girly Bruiser Hmm Charlotte, Cousin Cassie, Malibu McKenzie, Sierra Sherraton, almost too many to name. Emphasised with the Wrestlicious title being a tiara. Granola Girl: Marley (Daizee Haze under her usual gimmick but a different name) Gratuitous Rap: The first couple of episodes opened with these as a nifty way for the characters to introduce themselves. It\'s almost amazing how many words actually rhyme with (or at least come close to rhyming with) "Wrestlicious". Hello, Nurse!: The entire cast was promoted as such, except maybe the Lunch Ladies Hollywood Nuns: Sister Ophelia wears the traditional \'penguin\' habit and also carries a cane around. Hollywood Voodoo: White Magic. Armed with voodoo dolls, magic stick and magic powder. Hospital Hottie: Malibu McKenzie in her only skits on the show. She\'s strangely advertised as a bikini babe but appears as this for some reason. Ironic Nickname White Magic is a villainous voodoo sorceress. White magic is typically thought of as healing and positive. The Naughty Girls\' names are Faith, Hope and Charity. Yes they\'re heels. Jail Bait: Juvi Hall, a Spiritual Successor of the GLOW character with the trope name. Kicking Ass in All Her Finery: Charlotte does indeed wrestle in that big poofy skirt of hers. Lady of War: Alexandra The Great has a \'conquer\' gimmick, if you hadn\'t already guessed. Lovable Jock: Amber Lively, the nice perky cheerleader. Lovely Angels: The Naughty Girls, The Lunch Ladies, The Southern Belles, TNT, The Bristols. And then there\'s Jimmy\'s Angels... Magic Realism: White Magic\'s Voodoo Dolls and spells apparently work. Ms. Fanservice: Inverted. Sister Ophelia and the Lunch Ladies are the only characters that don\'t provide Fanservice. Naughty Nuns: Averted. Sister Ophelia is a non Fanservice character managing the Naughty Girls. Though she does cane the girls if they misbehave and keeps a close eye on the money box. Nerds Are Sexy: Paige Webb, with whom it is a running gag. No Celebrities Were Harmed: See Take That below. Non-Action Guy: None of the male regulars on the show are actual wrestlers. The One Guy: The all-women\'s show has only about five on screen males. Panty Shot: Amber Lively\'s cartwheel demonstrates both her athleticism and gives the audience a glimpse up her skirt. Charlotte too, though she\'s wearing pantaloons. Parasol of Prettiness: Charlotte and Savannah carry them around. Pink Means Feminine: The ring ropes are pink to remind you that it\'s an all women show. Plenty of Blondes: Charlotte, Marley, Kandi Kisses, Cousin Cassie, Tyler Texas, Malibu McKenzie, Boot Camp Bailey, Juvi Hall. Pretty in Mink: Autumn Frost has furry covers on her boots and around her waist\u25ca. Pungeon Master: The commentator. Punny Name: Names like Brooke Lynn, Paige Webb, Juvi Hall, you get the picture. Running Gag In the form of segments such as Paige Webb\'s "You\'ve Got Male" where she gets a pervy e-mail from a fan each time. Felony keeps trying to escape her parole officer any chance she gets. Sassy Black Woman: Lil\' Slamm the rapper. Sexy Spectacles: Paige Webb who removes them to wrestle (to the disappointment of the commentator). Shaking Her Hair Loose: Paige Webb again who shakes her hair out of its bun at the start of matches. She Cleans Up Nicely: Not probably the intended effect but Mercedes Martinez isn\'t exactly known for her looks. But in her costume as Maria Toro, she\'s surprisingly pretty looking. Southern Belle: Charlotte and Savannah. Spicy Latina: Maria Toro and Bandita. Spiritual Successor: The show is essentially a reboot of Women of Wrestling (WOW), which itself was the successor to G.L.O.W. (Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling). A couple of WOW\'s girls played characters on the show too. Also of CRUSH, an extremely short lived promotion from 2003. They taped a pilot and shopped it around, but it never got picked up. Stripperiffic: Well duh, it\'s a women\'s wrestling show. Take Our Word for It: You\'ll have to take Jimmy Hart\'s word about Kandi Kisses and her horrific singing. Take That Lizzy Valentine confirmed that Kandi Kisses is a Take That to Britney Spears. Sierra Sheraton is of course one to Paris Hilton. Up to Eleven: Daizee Haze (Marley) and Lorelei Lee (Tyler Texas) have their normal gimmicks cranked up with Marley practising yoga in the ring and getting help from her "spirit guide" while Tyler Texas strums a big pink guitar down to the ring and says "yee-haw" before nearly every move. What Happened to the Mouse?: A promo hyping up the debut of The Bristols (played by The Blossom Twins) aired on one of the later episodes but they never appeared again. Where Da White Women At?: Black owner JV Rich is never seen without a bikini-clad woman, and each woman he\'s seen with is white. World of Action Girls: Well, some of them are models or such with no wrestling training but even they have a segment dedicated to getting them that training. World of Pun: Not just puns on the title either, commentary is an especially copious source of it ',
