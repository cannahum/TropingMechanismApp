Mystic inferno!\"Harry \u2014 yer a wizard.\"\u2014 Rubeus Hagrid, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone note\u00a0Commonly phrased as (per the film version) \"You're a wizard, Harry.\"A series of young adult novels by J. K. Rowling, starting off in the late 1990s. Blending fantasy with the nearly extinct British Boarding School genre, it was the debut work of Rowling, an ex-schoolteacher. Needless to say, there is a multimedia franchise revolving around them, consisting of a series of films, video games and various other merchandising tie-ins, but at the heart of it are the books.The basic story is simple: Harry Potter is a seemingly normal schoolboy, living with his resentful, abusive aunt and uncle after being orphaned in his infancy, who on his eleventh birthday discovers he isn't really normal at all. His parents were both powerful wizards, and Harry himself is the renowned defeater of Voldemort, would-be Evil Overlord of the wizarding world. Voldemort had attempted to kill Harry when the latter was only a year old, but for unknown reasons, the curse he cast at the boy afflicted himself instead, killing him... sort of.Harry goes to Hogwarts, the great school of magic, and is happy. There are the normal school troubles \u2014 bullies, unpleasant teachers, the three-headed dog guarding a mysterious something \u2014 but nothing serious, until he sees a dark shadow creeping through the forest. Investigating, he eventually discovers that Voldemort did not truly die. Though his body was destroyed, his spirit clung to life, seeking ways to return from death and resume his campaign of terror.The complete list of the books Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Quidditch Through the Ages The Tales of Beedle the BardTropes prevalent across the whole series: Tropes A to I Tropes J to R Tropes S To YAll was well.

It's more often found with women than with men, and is almost always either found as a trait of The Hero (see Red-Headed Hero) or The Hero's Love Interest (because Heroes Want Redheads). To qualify for this trope, it's important that:\n The character is a major character.\n The character is not in a work where You Gotta Have Blue Hair.\n The character isn't from a live-action work, unless they were artificially given these colors for the purpose of the work, or were chosen directly for it.\n The character has red hair and green eyes, and not pink/magenta hair or hazel/blue-green eyes, or even green hair and red eyes.\nLikely to be a Fiery Redhead, as Green Eyes often connote a similar kind of personality.\nThis image might have been influenced a lot by Maureen O'Hara and her various roles, which also influenced this to be the Phenotype Stereotype for an Irish person. It may also have something to do with the fact that red and green are complementary colours - which also may help to explain why so many red-headed characters are depicted wearing green, even if they aren't Irish.\n\nExamples\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0open/close all folders\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anime & Manga\u00a0\n\n Youko Nakajima from The Twelve Kingdoms is a prime example. She's the main character, and her red hair\u0086\u00a0 (which gets redder when she goes to the titular Kingdoms, along with her eyes turning green) marks her as different, so she is often harassed for it. It also marks her as a taika, someone who was meant to be in that world but was born on Earth by accident.\n Shirayuki from Snow White with the Red Hair is another prime example.\n Kurama of YuYu Hakusho, at least in his human form, but only in the anime. The crimson hair/leaf-green eyes combination in this case is a warning not to underestimate him, because, like his roses, he has thorns. It's also a hint at his nature as a Kitsune and a youkai, as there are folk stories of red-headed green-eyed people actually being foxes and in disguise and the shade of red being decidedly unnatural for a human.\n Hellsing's Pip Bernadotte, Love Interest of Seras Victoria. While he's a mercenary and an Anti-Hero to be traditionally sweet, he is the nicest of the guys in these series along with Sir Shelby Penwood. With the other men being Dracula, a deadly butler, Nazis, and Fanatic Vatican Crusaders, Pip looks like a saint.\n\n Brief in Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, whose red hair emphasizes his geeky qualities, and then, with the reveal of his eyes emphasizes he is attractive.\n Kino Makoto/Sailor Jupiter from Sailor Moon is one of the main characters and in the manga, and her hair red in color pictures, (brown in the anime). Word of God says that her eyes turn green after transforming into Jupiter, and they look more hazel/brown in her untransformed state in some artwork.\n Lydia from Earl and Fairy has this as a sign of her affinity with The Fair Folk. It's a source of great trouble for her due to the cultural discrimination people with red hair suffered in Victorian England, on top of the implications she might be a changeling.\n Nakaba from Reimei No Arcana is the protagonist. Her bright red hair causes her to be discriminated against, and her green eyes turn red when she uses her powers. She's also in the middle of a love triangle between the romantic lead, and her Childhood Friend.\n Lancerow Durell of After War Gundam X isn't The Hero or a Love Interest, but he was Jamil Neate's Rival during the last war, an ex-Newtype, and an Anti-Villain in the Space Revolutionary Army. He plays a very important part of the final arc and ultimately switches to the heroes' side.\n The final major cyborg introduced in Gunslinger Girl, Petra, is one of these. Prior to being made a cyborg she looked very different though, far shorter and being a blue eyed blonde.\n Misty from Pok\u00e9mon was the leading female for the Kanto and Johto arcs. She was often portrayed with Blue Eyes but since the leap to digital has been almost always consistently depicted as having green eyes. In the manga adaptation The Electric Tale of Pikachu she was originally a brunette but was later redesigned more similarly to her anime design.\n Misty in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures is much less prominent but still counts. She is one of the major Kanto gym leaders and has unrequited feelings for Red.\n The protagonist of Venus Versus Virus, Sumire, has dark red hair and green eyes. Her eyes turn red when she goes into Berserk mode.\n In Panzer World Galient, Hilmuka has this combination of colour of hair and eyes. She's one of the main characters and an important ally of Jordy, teaching him to handle Galient and sharing intelligence about the enemy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comic Books\u00a0\n DC comics' Wally West, the third Flash\n X-Men:\n Jean Grey is the one of the original members of the team, the love interest of Cyclops, and took center stage in what is arguably the franchise's best known story.\n Also Jean's daughter from an alternate future, Rachel, and her clone, Madelyne Pryor.\n Also Hope Summers, a very important player in the X-Men franchise and obviously takes after Jean.\n Fongji Wu, a mixed-race Tibetan girl and the previous bearer of both the Phoenix Force and the Iron Fist mantle.\n Rogue was occasionally colored with just straight-up red hair with green eyes, especially during her most popular years in the '90s, but did eventually move to brown.\n Mary Jane Watson from Spider-Man is the love interest of Peter Parker, has been a supermodel, and is known for striking good looks, as opposed to Gwen Stacy's more traditional Girl Next Door appearance (despite MJ being the literal girl next door).\n\n Batwoman / Kate Kane, the main character of her own series, whose coloration, especially her red hair, is starkly emphasized against dark and bleak Gotham.\n Lyra, daughter of Thundra and The Hulk, combines this with green skin.\n Lena Luthor, at least in Supergirl: Cosmic Adventurs in the 8th Grade. Also the \"Lex's daughter\" incarnation in The DCU ... although in this case her green eyes may have indicated that she was still connected to Brainiac.\n Superman has two major characters who meet this description. One is Lana Lang, his childhood best friend, confidante, and first love (and who briefly acted as a surrogate mother to his cousin, Supergirl). The other is archenemy Lex Luthor, who has envious green eyes and flaming red eyebrows as an adult, and possessed a full head of red hair as a teenager.\n Caitlin Fairchild from Gen\u00b9\u00b3 is this physically as well as usually personality wise (though she can be a Fiery Redhead when it comes to protecting the others).\n Poison Ivy, whose coloration not only emphasizes her seductive qualities, but also seems more dangerous and earthy.\n Rogue's hair is usually referred to as \"auburn\", but was colored more red in earlier comics. And her eyes are green.\n Starfire, with golden skin. Note that while it's true that Starfire has green eyes, that doesn't mean she has normal eyes with green irises... it means her eyes are solid green.\n Leetah and her daughter Ember, as well as Redlance and his daughter Tyleet in ElfQuest. Notable because Leetah and Ember are both dark-skinned. Averted with Kaslen in Hidden Years, as she turned out to have no special significance to the plot.\n The Incredibles: Mezmerella.\n Archie Comics:\n Third-Option Love Interest Cheryl Blossom is one of the few characters that consistently has colored eyes. Most characters have Black Bead Eyes.\n Archie himself has green eyes in Archie Comics (2015). In the classic continuity he usually had blue eyes.\n\n Delirium from The Sandman is this on occasion. She can change her hair color/length at will (but mostly it happens by accident), though it usually has some red in it and is fully red at least once. Usually has one green and one blue eye, though when she composes herself and behaves seriously they are the same color.\n Aphrodite in the \"Adventures in Olympus\" arc of Flare, notable in that the most beautiful person to exist has this combination of color, and is in fact often portrayed as a redhead in art, especially Pre-Raphaelite and Neoclassicism.\n Rose in the Wolverine miniseries Origin, who is intended as a \"proto-Jean Grey\" in Wolverine's story, just as Dog is a \"proto-Sabretooth\".\n Angel Love, the main character of the eponymous comic book series.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fan Works\u00a0\n\n Assassin, adventuress and safari-savvy Johanna Smith-Rhodes, from the Discworld continuum fanfic Nature Studies. She started life as a rather attitudinal \"Sed-Efrrrrikan\" with all the knobs turned up to eleven.\n Julia Carlyle, from the Daria/Legion of Super-Heroes crossover Legion of Lawndale Heroes, has dark red hair and green eyes.\n The (in)famous Axis Powers Hetalia OC, Pixiv!Scotland. Also some renditions of Ireland, following the aformentioned Phenotype Stereotype. Others make him/her a Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette instead, specifically to go against it.\n\n Mary Jane Watson, the protagonist of Ultimate Spider-Woman: Change With The Light, has long, fire-red hair and bright green eyes.\n Captain Kanril Eleya, the protagonist of Bait and Switch (STO), is has red hair and dark green eyes.\n Judicial-Cadet Jacqueline Quartermain from this series of Dredd fanfics is a gorgeous teenager with hair like \"new copper wiring\" and brilliant green eyes. She's from Boston and word of God is that she is ethnically Irish, perhaps justifying the choice.\n In The Ultimate Evil, we're introduced Nataline Homato, a demon hunter who's described for a reason as Buffy The Vampire Slayer's long lost cousin.\n In most Death Note fanworks where Matt is featured, he will have red hair and green eyes (and, of course, a much larger role than he ever had in either the anime or the manga.) This is because his hair color was undefined in the manga (until the 10th anniversary colorized publication, where he had the brown hair and blue eyes he was given in the anime). Fanon decided that his hair color was red, and his eyes were green.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Film \u2014 Animated\u00a0\n Danny from Cats Don't Dance, the lead, is also an example of an orange-furred cat with green eyes.\n Hans in Frozen, a very handsome prince who is an immediate source of attraction to main character Anna, herself an example (though her eye color is closer to teal).\n Thomas O'Malley and Toulouse (one of Duchess' kittens) from The Aristocats, both ginger cats with cat-green eyes, in contrast with Duchess and Marie's white fur (see: blonde) and blue eyes.\n Taran from The Black Cauldron, the hero of the story.\n Quasimodo, the protagonist from The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n Queen Athena from The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, whose red hair is very relevant to her physical resemblance to Ariel.\n Jessie as the Affirmative Action Girl lead in Toy Story 2, as well as being Buzz's Love Interest in Toy Story 3.\n Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the wife of the titular character. It's easy to miss, as few people are looking at her eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Film \u2014 Live-Action\u00a0\n As played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Daphne Blake in the live-action Scooby-Doo movies, whose hair is dyed to give her this look.\n Layla from Sky High is worth mentioning due her being an Expy (at least in powers; her personality is quite different) of Poison Ivy, another character with notable Red hair and green eyes that has power over plants.\n Though in the \"Harry Potter\" books, Harry has green eyes and Ron blue, this is inverted in the film versions with Harry being played by Daniel Radcliffe (blue eyes) and Ron by Rupert Grint (red hair/green eyes).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Literature\u00a0\n In Dragon Blood, the magician \"Jade Eyes\", named for those green eyes, has red hair. It is mentioned that his beauty is not the reason why he's the highest mage in rank at the king's court\u2014he's also a powerful mage who makes life difficult for the heroes.  Actually, in terms of power, he's the main villain.\n All of the Pennykettles from The Last Dragon Chronicles are this.\n Star Wars Legends:\n Mara Jade may be the ultimate example: a Badass and former Evil Redhead who was so enormously popular, she joined the good guys, became The Hero Luke's long-time partner, and was eventually happily married to him. Until Legacy of the Force, but no one likes what happened there.\n Scout, the Jedi Padawan equivalent of Batman in Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, has these.\n Jedi Apprentice's Clat'Ha is only in a few of the books, but she's significant in them.\n Anne Shirley of Anne of Green Gables, where her hair and eye color is significant in that she personally dislikes the combination.\n Lily Evans Potter from Harry Potter series is a Posthumous Character example: a formidable witch of her own, she was the love interest to James, The Hero of the previous generation, and friends with Severus Snape, until they had a falling out, but whose death became Snape's primary motivation.\n Gemma Doyle, the protagonist from the A Great and Terrible Beauty trilogy. Her mother too.\n Maharet and Mekare from The Vampire Chronicles, as well as Jesse.\n Partly justified with Jesse, as she is Maharet's distant descendant. All three women are capable of communicating with spirits.\n Ellysetta Baristani, the main character of Tairen Soul.\n\n Beatrice Bailey, the protagonist of The Witches of Bailiwick. Her specialty is controlling the weather, which goes with the nature aspect of this trope.\n Christopher Hitchens mentioned this trope while criticizing a stereotypically Irish-American character in John Updike's last novel.\n The title character of Fire is red-headed and green-eyed and beautiful beyond the lot of ordinary people; her hair and eye color both coming from her mother.\n Felicity Merriman, a main character from the American Girls Collection, one of the few redheads who, by the nature of this trope, of course is paired with green eyes.\n Vesper Holly, Mary Sue protagonist of a Narm Charm-tastic children's adventure series by Lloyd Alexander. Just look at that name!\n Sennar, one of the main characters of the Chronicles of the Emerged World.\n\n Cherry Valance from The Outsiders is the redhead with green eyes that starts all the trouble in the book, while allowing Ponyboy, the protagonist, to change his view on Socs.\n Kvothe in The Kingkiller Chronicle, who has \"true red\" hair. His eyes even have the bonus of changing to different shades of green according to his mood.\n April, one of the main characters from Everworld is mentioned a few times to be this.\n Rachel Morgan and her mother in The Hollows.\n Sioned, one of the main characters from Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince stories.\n\n Finnick Odair of The Hunger Games, who is not only described as very attractive, but the only major redhead of the series, and one of the most important secondary characters.\n\n The Girl from The Club Dumas; her very light green eyes are mentioned many times as being captivating, likely because she is in fact a fallen angel. In the film adaptation, The Ninth Gate, however, she has different coloring.\n Mildmay, one of the viewpoint characters of Doctrine of Labyrinths. For most of the story, he's one of only two-redhaired people, the other being his brother, and the only redhead with green eyes. Felix often describes them as being like jade.\n\n A Brother's Price makes a point of noting that all of the princesses fit this trope, to the point where their hair is called \"the royal red\". Cira/Halley actually dyed her hair black to throw off suspicion.\n Ce'Nedra from David Eddings' The Belgariad and The Mallorean, who is the beautiful, Fiery Redhead love interest of The Hero, and is part-dryad, so comes with a nature emphasis too.\n Brian O'Neill as well as his children Molly and Michael, in Claire Madras's Ireland-set Historical Fiction novel Sissi in Ireland.\n\n The heroine of The Mortal Instruments, Clary Fray has green eyes and red hair. She got them from her mother Jocelyn.\n Pippi Longstocking.\n Sister Fidelma from the books by Peter Tremayne.\n\n Elsabeth Soesten, the main protagonist of the fantasy novella No Good Deed..., has copper hair and green eyes as prominent character traits.\n\n\n\n Ruby-haired, emerald-eyed Aristomache of The First Dwarf King is one of the most notable characters in the book who isn't Jani.\n Iris would also count, save for the fact that she has blue eyes instead of green.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Live Action Television\u00a0\n Merlin in the 1998 miniseries, where it appears that both young and old Merlins's eyes were digitally enhanced to be green beyond reality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Music\u00a0\n In Dolly Parton's song \"Jolene\", the titular character (and the narrator's romantic rival) has \"flaming locks of auburn hair\" and \"eyes of emerald green\".\n William Sheller's song \"Les miroirs dans la boue\" (The Mirrors in the Mud) is all about a young girl with \"green eyes bathed in red hair\" (\"les yeux verts noy\u00e9s de cheveux roux\").\n Gaelic Storm's Green Eyes, Red Hair is all about this. The woman in question overlaps with Fiery Redhead too.\n The title character of Erutan's \"The Willow Maid\", who is described as having \"hair like fire, her eyes an emerald sheen\", a tree fairy that a young man becomes infatuated with and tries repeatedly to get her to go with him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mythology\u00a0\n Thor in Norse Mythology is a rough tough badass god, who happens to be redheaded and green-eyed. Yet when he had to cross-dress as a woman in Thrymskvida, all the giants were so smitten by \"her\" dazzling looks that they failed to notice many, many less-than-subtle hints of a trap...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tabletop Games\u00a0\n Of the pantheon worshiped by humans in the Forgotten Realms, the green-eyed redhead, Sune, is the Love Goddess.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Video Games\u00a0\n Mass Effect 2:\n The Bridge Bunny Kelly Chambers is probably the most trouble-free and relaxing romantic interest (for both genders), and the only redhead.\n Default female Commander Shepard is another example, whose first face model was given this coloration. Emphasizing the pervasiveness of this trope is that when a fan poll was created to choose the new look of Commander Shepard for Mass Effect 3, so many people indicated that their vote depended a lot on getting a redheaded, green-eyed Shepard with their favorite face model that the developers posted a second poll allowing people to pick the coloration, and the green-eyed redhead won by a large margin.\n Aveline Vallen in Dragon Age II, is the first companion you pick up and is a green-eyed redhead. Unusually she's also one of the two companions who cannot be Hawke's Love Interest. Much of her character plot in the game focuses on her surprising subversion of gender roles, so it's possible this coloration was picked for that reason.\n If you squint hard enough, you'll notice that pre-zergification Sarah Kerrigan from Starcraft series had grayish-green eyes (especially on that photo Raynor has of her in SC2), and she was a redhead.\n Luke Fon Fabre from Tales of the Abyss. This is actually a plot point, as a noble with red hair and green eyes has a great role in a prophesy that will lead to world prosperity. Asch the Bloody is also a green-eyed red head, which is significant because  in truth, he's the redhead from the prophesy, and Luke is only his clone.\n It later becomes a plot point that Natalia is not one of these, as every blood member of the Kimlascan royal family is a green-eyed redhead.\n Princess Carranya in part II of Love And War, who is the heroine and only playable female character in the episode. Whether she ends up as Ryan's love interest is strongly hinted at, but not confirmed.\n In the remake of The Secret of Monkey Island, Elaine Marley, love interest of the hero, is given red hair and green eyes.\n Saya Kho in the X-Universe series. Red hair, green eyes, spectacular body, and she started a war that eventually resulted in the entire jumpgate network shutting down.\n Crash Bandicoot:\n The titular characters has green eyes and red fur. His hair was red until Crash Twinsanity made it brown.\n His little sister Coco usually has the same fur and eye colors but is downplayed by her blonde hair.\n Triss Merigold, the main love interest in The Witcher and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. Interestingly, in Sapkowski's novels (on which the games are based) she has blue eyes.\n Misty from Pok\u00e9mon is one of these. She's one of the most iconic gym leaders, partially because she's the second in the series but mostly because of the anime.\n Elora from Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! is a faun with red hair and green eyes. She's the main female character but disappears aside from a cameo at the end of the third game.\n Gaige is your mad scientist cyborg teen Pre-order/DLC from Borderlands 2, surprisingly capable in taking out just as many bandits as a seasoned veteran who recently got kicked out of the military. Oh, and she sawed her own arm off out of doing a science fair project.\n The main character of Star Fox is a green-eyed red fox named Fox McCloud.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Webcomics\u00a0\n\n Mistress Sixx from Collar 6 is another lesbian love interest to the protagonist.\n The Title Character of Cucumber Quest, destined to save the world and thus rather significant for its continuous survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lucy Thompson, Superhero School secretary and best-friend to the lead in Pulse.\n Keychain of Creation's Marena, Lancer heroine protagonist and sort-of love interest to Misho combines this with Dark-Skinned Redhead.\n Adele of Agents of the Realm is a dyed redhead, but she's the first friend Norah makes on the campus and one of the Agents.\n\n Penny, The Hero from Penny Blackfeather, as revealed when the comic turns full color.\n Proxy, Tripp's bodyguard from the future.\n Wren from Radio Silence.\n Tegan from Plume, a green-eyed, red-haired Hooker with a Heart of Gold who gives Corrick and Vesper clues where to find Dom and later joins the main ensemble.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Web Original\u00a0\n Cassidy Cain, the titular protagonist of Grandmaster of Theft. She's passionate and sensible as through being a Spirited Young Lady crossed with Classy Cat-Burglar Guile Heroine.\n\n\n The Porcelain Doctor from Dead West. His eyes are technically grey, but since he usually wears green, and keeps on glasses, Gervas mostly desribe his eyes \"green and calming as the sea\".\n We're Alive has Samantha, Datu's love interest who, unfortunately, ended up on the floor of the Arena\n Red vs. Blue has Agent Carolina, the main character of the flashback parts of the Project Freelancer arc.\n Penny in RWBY. Not a Fiery Redhead, though.\n Pyrrha Nikos has very long, very red hair and some of the greenest eyes of any character. She is one of Beacon's star pupils, being Mistral's four-times champion, and has a reputation for being untouchable, partly due to her extremely powerful Semblance which controls magnetism.  She's also Too Cool to Live and Too Good for This Sinful Earth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Western Animation\u00a0\n Kim Possible, the main character, is both an Action Girl and Action Girlfriend example.\n Examples from the DCAU:\n Hawkgirl/Shayera, in Justice League Unlimited, as shown in the trope image, notable in that she was traditionally portrayed with blue eyes in the comics.\n Lana Lang, in Superman: The Animated Series, who, similar to Hawkgirl above, often didn't have green eyes.\n Pamela Isley, a.k.a. Poison Ivy, in the Batman episode \"Pretty Poison\", when she uses her stunning looks to get close to the men who wronged her (one of them even proposes to her) and attempts to assassinate them.\n Gotham City socialite Veronica Vreeland, one of Batman's love interests (and the only redhead amongst them).\n Gargoyles has multiple examples.\n Demona, one of the main antagonists, though ordinarily black-eyed like most gargoyles, qualifies  when in human form.\n Fox, recurring villain employee of and married to the other main antagonist David Xanatos.\n Starfire from Teen Titans. When she's actively using her powers, she has solid green eyes like her comic book counterpart. When she's not, her eyes have are more like normal human \"green eyes\", but the sclera (the \"white\" of the eye) is also green (a paler shade than the iris).\n Kiva from Megas XLR, the only major female character, the only redhead, one of the best looking characters from the show, and eventual love interest of one of the other characters.\n Sam from Totally Spies!, the only redhead of the group (and the rest of the group follows typical cartoon colorations with black hair and brown eyes and blonde hair and blue eyes). She even wears green as her color!\n Gwen Tennyson from Ben 10. The main female character, cousin to the main character, and a part of the most prominent love story in the series with eventual group member Kevin.\n The title character in Atomic Betty.\n Pickles the drummer in Metalocalypse has this sort of coloring, and in his case it's probably due to being \"very Irish-American.\"\n\n Young Justice:\n Kid Flash/Wally West, in accordance to his comic book counterpart.\n Garfield Logan\u2014temporarily. His eyes start out blue, then turn green later.

In the final product he's a brunette and has typical, cartoony black eyes.\n Valerie Frizzle from Magic School Bus. Though in the cartoon and book series she, like the kids, usually has typical cartoon eyes, we do get to see her eye color in one book: Explores the Senses.\n A male example, Dr. Krieger from Archer is red-headed, as well as one of the only two green-eyed main characters (along with Lana Kane).\n In Total Drama, Izzy's red hair is more toward the orange end of the spectrum\u2014the color of fire\u2014to emphasize her pyromaniac tendencies. Not only are her eyes green, she also typically wears green.\n Word of God is Wendy from Gravity Falls is this however the art style doesn't show her eye color. She's one of the Pines twins best friends and works at the Mystery Shack.\n Frankie, like everyone in Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, has Black Bead Eyes however her drivers license states she has green eyes. Frankie works at Foster's and is one of Mac's best friends, and the object of his affections.\n The titular protagonist of Strawberry Shortcake has Green Eyes in the 2009 incarnation.\n My Little Pony: Equestria Girls: Sunset Shimmer is a rare antagonist version of this trope.

Now a days her eyes are still usually a light green but her hair continues to be it's original black.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Real Life\u00a0\n Male example: Probably the most significant figure of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was Genghis Khan, who was described as having red hair and green eyes. Those traits are actually more common than you'd expect in Central Asia.\n\n\n", "type": "trope", "links": {"Fan Works": {"Axis Powers Hetalia":
